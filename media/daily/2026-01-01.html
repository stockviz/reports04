<h2>Tobacco &amp; Cigarette Stocks Tumble As New Taxation Structure Comes Into Effect From February 1 2026-01-01 13:27</h2>
<p><a href="https://stockviz.github.io/reports02/eq-in/risk/in.ITC.html">ITC</a> <a href="https://stockviz.github.io/reports02/eq-in/risk/in.GODFRYPHLP.html">GODFRYPHLP</a></p>
<p>Tobacco stocks, including ITC and Godfrey Phillips, plunged sharply—with ITC down nearly 8% and Godfrey Phillips over 11%—following a government notification introducing a new taxation structure effective February 1, 2026. The new structure imposes a 40% GST on cigarettes (up from 28%) and adds a fresh excise duty of ₹2.10 to ₹8.50 per stick (₹2,100 to ₹8,500 per thousand sticks), alongside existing taxes like the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD). Contrary to earlier assumptions that the 40% GST would subsume other levies, the new excise duties are <em>in addition</em> to it, significantly increasing the tax burden.</p>
<p>Previously, total taxes accounted for 50–55% of MRP; now that could rise to 65–80%. This may force cigarette companies to raise prices by 18–35%, impacting volumes due to potential shifts to illegal or cheaper alternatives. If companies avoid price hikes, EBIT could fall by over 40% given the high-margin nature of the business. Historically, tax increases led to partial price pass-through and volume declines, but the current scale is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The market is reacting negatively, pricing in worst-case scenarios. ITC hit its lowest level since March 2023, trading around ₹370, with heavy volumes—over 10 crore shares traded early. Godfrey Phillips faced even sharper losses due to its premium international brands like Marlboro being more vulnerable to smuggling. Investor concerns center on lack of clarity on final tax incidence, margin pressure, volume risks, and potential growth in the illegal cigarette trade, all affecting profitability and government revenue long-term.</p>

<p>Kiri Industries has exited its 11-year international investment in DyStar, receiving over ₹5,200 crore in net proceeds after taxes and expenses. The company plans to deploy more than 90% of the funds into new, futuristic growth projects in India focused on import substitution, including announced investments in fertilizers and copper, marking a shift into diversified sectors beyond its core dyes and specialty chemicals business. A portion of the proceeds may be distributed as a special dividend, though the exact amount will be decided by the board. Current promoter shares are under negative pledge and will be fully de-pledged. The board will deliberate soon on fund allocation, requiring possible shareholder approval for material decisions. While past investor interactions indicate support for growth investments, final decisions remain subject to board and shareholder review. The company expects over 30% IRR and a 3-4 year payback on new projects. Foreign institutional investors hold about 22% stake. No additional benefits are going to promoters; all proceeds flow to the company.</p>

<p>Wockhardt received fast-track approval from the European Medicines Agency for its antibacterial drug Zaynich (Zenik), targeting severe drug-resistant infections. Approval in Europe is expected by mid-2026, earlier than anticipated, due to the urgent need amid rising multi-drug resistance affecting over 200,000 patients. The drug is likely to gain approval for multiple indications—bloodstream, stomach, and urinary tract infections—boosting its market potential. Launch timelines for India and the US are also targeted for mid-2026. Revenue will follow a “hockey stick” curve, with slow initial uptake over 18 months, significant acceleration beginning in FY28. Peak sales in Europe are projected at $400–500 million, with no expected competition for several years. Pricing discussions will commence post-approval; Germany allows immediate marketing with price approval within six months, while the UK offers a streamlined reimbursement pathway with upfront NHS commitments of up to £20 million over 2–3 years. Zaynich marks a milestone as a first-of-its-kind global launch from an Indian company, with long-term growth hinging on market access and adoption post-approval.</p>

<p>Cigarette prices in India are expected to rise significantly from February 1 due to a proposed 25-40% increase in tax burden, with retail prices potentially jumping from ₹18 to ₹72 per cigarette. Manufacturers like ITC, Godfrey Phillips, and VST Industries face major challenges: ITC and Godfrey Phillips saw share prices drop by up to 17%, with ITC hitting a 52-week low. Analysts predict a 20-40% price hike across segments to offset costs, risking lower sales volumes if passed to consumers or margin squeeze if not. MK Global notes ITC and Godfrey Phillips will bear the brunt, while VST Industries faces lesser impact due to its product mix. In the medium term, ITC may regain market share from Godfrey Phillips in the DSFT (Double Stick Filter Tip) and RSFT segments. The tax on MRP is expected to rise to 73%, nearing WHO’s recommended 75%, up from the current 53%, driving stock declines. The situation remains fluid and closely watched.</p>

<p>Godfrey Phillips fell 10%, marking its largest single-day drop since March 2024, declining for the third time in four sessions with unusually high volume—10 lakh shares traded vs. a 20-day average of 77,000. The stock is down nearly 40% from its 52-week high (~3950) and has historically struggled in January, posting negative returns in 12 of the last 15 years. In contrast, Panama Petrochem surged 9–11%, its best gain since February last year, on exceptionally high volume—9 lakh shares traded vs. a 20-day average of 7,000. The stock is above its 100-day moving average (293) with the 200-day at ~330, though it’s down 22% from its 52-week high above 400. January has been positive for it in five of the last six years. Vishnu Prakash R Punglia continued its steep decline, falling for the second consecutive day and in 20 of the last 25 sessions. Trading at around ₹50, it’s down 85% from its December 2024 peak of ~345 and nearly 50% below its ₹99 IPO price, with 70 lakh shares traded versus a 13 lakh average.</p>

<h2>Why Is ITC Share Price Falling Today? | Jefferies Has This To Say</h2>
<p><a href="https://stockviz.github.io/reports02/eq-in/risk/in.ITC.html">ITC</a></p>
<p>The Indian government has notified a sharp rise in excise duty on cigarettes, with the compensation period ending and a potential tax hike exceeding 30%, over and above the recently revised 40% GST. Jefferies notes significant uncertainty but warns of a negative impact on ITC’s cigarette volumes, especially if price increases aren’t fully passed on to consumers. ITC may raise prices by at least 15% to offset costs, but failure to do so would pressure margins. There are also concerns about increased illicit trade. The impact on volumes and margins is expected from Q3 or Q4 onward, affecting ITC’s earnings.</p>

<p>In 2026, corporate India is poised for transformative changes driven by key developments in 2025. First, the technology sector will see heightened disruption as AI-driven deals by TCS and Coforge in late 2025 spill into 2026, reshaping traditional IT. Second, financial services will experience a shift with RBI’s growing comfort with foreign strategic investments, boosting FDI and altering competitive dynamics. Third, a surge in IPOs is expected, including major startups like Flipkart, PhonePe, Zepto, and Ola, with Reliance Industries planning its first major IPO in two decades via Reliance Jio, marking a landmark corporate event. Fourth, Tata Group faces significant developments, including potential leadership continuity for N. Chandrasekaran amid ongoing Tata Trusts’ governance resolution involving government intervention. Lastly, the U.S.-India tariff war, which created uncertainty in 2025, is expected to resolve in 2026, positively impacting export-oriented sectors. These five trends will define the corporate landscape in India in 2026.</p>

<h2>‘$100 Increase In LME Copper Adds Rs 25 Crore To Profitability’: Hindustan Copper MD To NDTV Profit</h2>
<p><a href="https://stockviz.github.io/reports02/eq-in/risk/in.HINDCOPPER.html">HINDCOPPER</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hindustan Copper CMD Sanjeev Kumar Singh attributes surging copper prices (up 42% YoY) and strong stock performance (up 112% in 12 months) to a persistent supply-demand mismatch, driven by stagnant global production and rising demand from AI data centers, EVs, renewables, and infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>He expects the deficit to persist through FY26 due to constrained supply and increasing global demand, with limited new copper deposits and ongoing supply chain challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>For every $100 increase in LME copper prices, Hindustan Copper sees a ₹20–25 crore improvement in profitability.</p></li>
<li><p>The company plans to ramp up production from current levels (~3.47 million tons of ore) to 12.2 million tons by FY31, through expansion in Malanjkhand, revival of closed mines in Jharkhand (targeting 5 million tons), and development of K3 mines in Rajasthan (2.9 million tons).</p></li>
<li><p>Current domestic production meets only 4–5% of India’s copper needs; expansion aims to significantly reduce import dependence.</p></li>
<li><p>Capex of around ₹5,000 crore planned over 5–6 years: ₹2,000 crore for Malanjkhand, ₹1,000 crore each for K3 and Jharkhand. JSW will independently invest ₹2,400–2,500 crore in the Rakha mine under a revenue-sharing model.</p></li>
<li><p>Hindustan Copper is enhancing reserves (added 134 million tons in 3 years), boosting exploration spending from ₹35 crore to ₹50 crore annually, and collaborating with global major Codelco and institutions like IIT Dhanbad for R&amp;D and deep exploration.</p></li>
<li><p>The company is exploring critical minerals in tailing dumps—a first in India—and has tied up multiple MoUs with Maharatna firms and state governments for new mining blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>No hedging is done; sales are based on spot LME prices, making revenues fully exposed to market volatility.</p></li>
<li><p>EBITDA margins have improved from 23% in FY21 to ~38% trailing, with the company targeting to sustain above 40% through operational efficiency and scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Copper prices are currently above $12,400/ton; outlook remains bullish due to structural deficits, though no formal price forecasting is provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Funding is secured via strong internal cash flows, QIP approval, and bond issuances; negligible debt (₹120 crore).</p></li>
<li><p>The company reaffirms commitment to national self-reliance in copper and long-term value creation amid favorable macro trends.</p></li>

The drug targets multi-drug resistant infections affecting ~200,000 patients in Europe, with peak European sales potential of $400–500 million and global potential of $1–2 billion, half from the US. Revenue contribution is expected to begin in FY28, growing slowly before accelerating after 18 months. Wockhardt plans to expand into other global markets within 3–6 months post-US/EU approvals.</p>
<p>The company expects McNiff sales in India to reach ₹80–100 crore in FY26/27, with regulatory filings underway in Saudi Arabia, Latin America, Brazil, and Mexico for emerging markets. Wockhardt is not pursuing McNiff in the US immediately.</p>
<p>Regarding the GLP-1 and obesity drug space, Wockhardt plans a delayed entry using cost-efficient recombinant technology, avoiding early competition dominated by semi-synthetic products. Insulin and diabetes treatments remain core, with no expected negative impact from rising GLP-1 usage.</p>
<p>Khorakiwala reaffirms a vision for sales to reach ₹6,000 crore by FY28 with 15–20% EBITDA margins, potentially doubling to ₹12,000 crore by FY31, driven by Zyniquib’s global rollout and improving operations.</p>
<p>The company has ₹1,700 crore debt but substantial cash reserves and expects cash-neutral operations by FY26, turning cash-positive thereafter. No near-term equity raise is planned; instead, Wockhardt is pursuing out-licensing deals in Europe, with updates expected during the year.</p>

<h2>India Can Be An Outperformer If The AI Theme Outperforms: S Naren Of ICICI Prudential | Outlook 2026</h2>
<p><code>ICICIAMC</code> <a href="https://stockviz.github.io/reports02/eq-in/risk/in.ENTERO.html">ENTERO</a> <a href="https://stockviz.github.io/reports02/eq-in/risk/in.AKUMS.html">AKUMS</a> <a href="https://stockviz.github.io/reports02/eq-in/risk/in.ASIANPAINT.html">ASIANPAINT</a></p>
<p>S. Narain, ED and CIO at ICICI Prudential AMC, discusses market outlook for 2026, emphasizing that India can outperform if the AI theme continues to lead globally. He notes markets are in a mature bull phase with no broad cheap valuations, necessitating active stock picking rather than sector or market-cap bets. The focus is on well-researched, deeply corrected stocks across all sectors and sizes—especially big underperformers excluded from the AI rally—where risk-reward is favorable, targeting 15–20% returns rather than home runs.</p>
<p>Opportunities exist in unloved segments like select pharma, IT, and FMCG names, including past examples such as Asian Paints, where fundamentals may rebound after prolonged underperformance. There is no dominant sectoral theme today akin to past cycles (e.g., PSU or metals), and investors must rely on rigorous analysis using abundant public data.</p>
<p>While multi-asset allocation was previously attractive due to favorable Nifty-to-gold/silver ratios, those signals no longer support allocations to precious metals. Now, asset allocation without gold/silver is seen as safer, despite strong investor demand for metals. Exporters have benefited from currency tailwinds and potential trade resolutions, but valuations aren’t cheap enough broadly to be compelling, except possibly in isolated small-cap cases or block-sale situations.</p>
<p>Narain expresses concern about U.S. AI-driven tech valuations being overheated, though admits limited ability to judge precisely. While a correction could ripple into India, Indian equities are expected to outperform relatively. Heavy IPO supply in 2025–2026 remains a structural cap on market returns, as India’s buoyant IPO market offers high valuations across sectors—unlike global markets focused only on AI.</p>
<p>Lastly, he expects better earnings in 2026 due to government stimulus through rate cuts, tax reductions, and boosted consumption, though the extent to which this is priced in remains uncertain. Overall, moderate market returns are anticipated, demanding discipline, deep research, and diversified idea generation across market caps and sectors.</p>

<p>Motilal Oswal maintains a “buy” rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of ₹2,500, citing steady business growth, sustained ROA of around 2%, range-bound NIMs with an upward bias, and declining credit costs trending toward a 55–60 basis point range. It forecasts ROE of 12.7% for FY27. Kotak Institutional Equities maintains a “buy” call on Mahindra &amp; Mahindra with a target of ₹4,350, expecting sustained growth driven by tractor segment tailwinds, new product launches, and export-led auto division growth, with leadership maintained across all business segments.</p>

<p>From February 1, additional excise duty on tobacco products and a health and security cess on pan masala will be imposed over and above the existing 40% GST, replacing the current compensation cess. This will increase total taxes on tobacco and related products by 25-40%. Companies like ITC, Godfrey Phillips, and VST Industries will face higher costs, likely passing them to consumers. Cigarette prices may rise from ₹18 to ₹72, potentially reducing sales volumes. If prices aren’t fully increased, company margins will be squeezed. Overall, higher taxes are expected to negatively impact both volumes and profitability in the sector.</p>

<h2>Vodafone Idea Gets Rs 5836 Cr Fund Infusion: What It Means For The Company? | Vodafone Share Price</h2>

<p>Vodafone Idea may receive ₹5,836 crore from its promoter, Vodafone PLC, as part of a pre-merger contingent liability adjustment mechanism established during the 2017 merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. The amount includes ₹2,077 crore in cash to be paid over the next 12 months, while the remaining ₹3,529 crore depends on the market value of Vodafone Idea shares, as it will be raised through open-market sales of Vodafone PLC’s stake. This liability cap was previously ₹8,369 crore, reduced to ₹6,394 crore due to prior payments, and now further revised to ₹5,836 crore, valid until December 31, 2025. While the fund infusion is procedural and known to the market, it is seen positively amid financial stress. However, Vodafone Idea clarified it has not received official communication from the government regarding a potential moratorium on dues, casting uncertainty. A moratorium without an AGR waiver would likely be viewed negatively by investors, despite the parent’s financial support.</p>

<h2>AGR Relief For VI | VI Continues To Be In A Difficult Operational And Financial Situation: Centrum</h2>

<p>Vodafone Idea’s (VI) stock fell over 10% despite government approval of a relief package on its AGR dues, which capped total liability at ₹87,695 crore with a five-year moratorium. The relief was seen as insufficient, as the market had expected a ~50% reduction. The high debt burden means VI will likely need massive fresh equity funding to survive and compete with stronger rivals like Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. While the moratorium reduces the NPV of payments by 25–30%, VI’s weak financial and operational position persists. The government’s support keeps VI alive but not positioned to thrive. Indus Towers is rated neutral, as VI’s survival supports tower revenue, though growth depends on VI raising further funds. Bharti Airtel remains a top pick due to better capital allocation and RoCE, while Reliance Jio’s potential listing could unlock significant value (~$150 billion). The telecom sector’s concentrated structure has boosted valuations, with Bharti seen as the primary pure-play telecom investment.</p>

Passenger vehicle sales may grow around 22%, two-wheelers by 30%, commercial vehicles by 12%, and tractors by 17–18%. Rising freight rates and the wedding season supported demand. Company-wise, Bajaj Auto may see 15% growth, Hero Motocorp, Royal Enfield, and TVS Motor 20–26%. Maruti Suzuki could grow 18–19%, Hyundai 14%, Tata Motors PV 16–17%, and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Auto 22%. Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors CV divisions may post double-digit growth. M&amp;M Tractors may grow 15%. Ola Electric registrations dropped 50% in December, while Ethaneurgent surged 60%, impacting their stock performance negatively. Overall, double-digit growth is expected across most auto segments.</p>
