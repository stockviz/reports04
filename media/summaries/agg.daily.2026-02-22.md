Search and rescue operations continue following a fatal avalanche on Castle Peak in California’s Sierra Nevada, with nine victims confirmed recovered; officials acknowledged a naming error involving the guides.  

Salesforce India CEO Arundhati Bhattacharya reported that while over 20,000 global customers have adopted AI agents, live deployments remain limited in India. Early adoption is concentrated in BFSI, automotive, healthcare, and education sectors, with Indian enterprises primarily evaluating return on investment. Premium pricing and co-innovation are observed, but AI agents are noted to enhance rather than replace frontline roles. A forthcoming “label force” tool is being developed to comply with Indian regulations on AI-generated content, with emphasis on balanced, flexible policy frameworks to sustain innovation.  

Nissan’s new entry-level 7-seater MPV, the Gravite, has been launched in India as a rebadged Renault Triber, priced at ₹5.65 lakh (ex-showroom). The vehicle features Nissan’s signature grille, projector headlamps, 15-inch alloy wheels, and a 1-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine paired with a 5-speed manual or AMT transmission. A CNG variant is planned, utilizing vertically stacked twin cylinders that reduce boot space. Interior includes an 8-inch touchscreen, digital instrument cluster, driver-only armrest, and 60/40 split rear seats. A limited-edition run of 1,000 units features orange accents. Boot capacity is constrained, particularly with CNG tanks, and roof-rack accessories are optional. Pricing for higher trims and the CNG model remains pending.  

At the India AI Impact Summit, Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora dismissed widespread job displacement fears, comparing AI agent deployment to the incremental rollout of self-driving technology. He emphasized that AI will automate repetitive tasks, leading to new roles in model training, deployment, and security. Strategic acquisitions—Chronosphere, CyberArc, and COI—were highlighted to build a comprehensive security platform for AI ecosystems. Arora noted that precision and safety requirements will slow full-scale enterprise deployment. He projected rising compute demand driven by consumer AI services and cautioned that energy and green infrastructure constraints may become critical bottlenecks. The AI wave is expected to expand bandwidth, drive employment, and support Palo Alto’s growth in securing AI and large language model attack surfaces.  

India and Brazil have formalized a mining and minerals agreement, with Prime Minister Modi aiming to elevate bilateral trade to over $20 billion within five years, reflecting a strengthened Global South alliance.  

Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe, credited India’s rapid digital adoption and talent development as foundational to its emerging AI leadership. He detailed AI integration across Adobe’s product suite, including Firefly, Express, and AI-enhanced PDFs and Photoshop, stressing application-focused innovation over raw computational power. India’s strength in the model and application layers of the AI stack was underscored, with optimism surrounding the new Indo-U.S. trade deal to enhance cross-border collaboration and business confidence.  

A panel discussion affirmed India’s inherent AI advantages: large population, vast data availability, and a robust developer talent pool. Government initiatives, including long-term tax incentives and data-center development, are fostering a conducive environment. Major investments by AWS (US$12.7 billion) and TCS (through partnerships with TPG and Tata Group) signal significant commitment. Strategic collaborations with chip makers, OEMs, Tata subsidiaries, and enterprise clients are highlighted as essential to accelerate infrastructure development, ensure data readiness, and transition workloads from on-premises to cloud. Persistent challenges include data migration (80–85% of applications still on-prem), talent upskilling, cultural resistance to experimentation, and logistical limitations in power, land, and water. A coordinated effort among government, global tech firms, and Indian enterprises is deemed critical to solidify India’s position as a leading AI hub within the next five years.  

Siro, a robot powered by an object-intelligence platform, demonstrated the ability to grasp novel, complex objects—transparent, reflective, or irregularly shaped—without prior training or explicit programming. By emulating early human visual processing, the system extracts geometry, texture, and motion cues to determine optimal grasp points, enabling curiosity-driven pick-and-place actions. This technology addresses a core limitation in AI-driven robotics and opens pathways for automating intricate assembly tasks in automotive, consumer electronics, and semiconductor manufacturing. Siro has advanced from prototype to commercial pilots, with planned integration into flexible, software-defined production lines capable of task switching without costly hardware reconfiguration.  

The third event of the 2026 DP World PGTI season took place at Kolkata’s Tollygunge Club, marking a milestone in the DP World–PGTI partnership to elevate professional golf in India. The tournament featured 126 players, with Indian professional Om Raksh Sohan securing his 12th professional title by shooting a 6-under 64 in the final round, finishing at 16-under 264. He earned ₹22.5 million and rose from 16th to 4th on the Order of Merit. The event highlighted the sport’s growing stature in India, supported by public figures such as Kapil Dev and Amitabh Kanta, and emphasized expanding competitive opportunities and fan engagement.  

The Monetary Policy Committee convened from February 4–6 and unanimously maintained the repo rate at 5.25% with a neutral stance, though Professor Ram Singh advocated for an accommodative shift. Dr. Nargesh Kumar cited a stronger economIt appears there is no additional information or follow-up questions at the end of the text, but I can help break it down into several key points regarding the three main topics:
