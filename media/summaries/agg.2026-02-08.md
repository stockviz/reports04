The venture targets personalized digital platforms for goal-based investing and rapid account onboarding.

The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee has kept the repo rate at 5.25% and maintained a neutral stance, without providing guidance on the rupee or short-term liquidity. The central bank's caution has been highlighted, with experts noting a likely "long pause" on rate moves and uncertainty due to pending revisions to the Consumer Price Index and GDP series.

India's defence budget has been increased for the fiscal year, with a 21% rise in capital outlay and a 24% jump in modernisation spending. The defence ministry has outlined a number of initiatives, including negotiations for new fighter jets and submarines, as well as plans to involve public-private consortia in key projects such as the AMCA/Amka stealth fighter project.

A recent India-U.S. trade agreement has lifted long-standing tariff fears, particularly for sectors such as auto components, making the U.S. market more accessible for Indian exporters. The agreement lowers tariffs from 50% to 18% for labour-intensive industries. In response to criticism, the Minister for Commerce and Industry reiterated the deal's potential to spur economic growth, job creation, and export opportunities, dismissing concerns of a rising trade deficit as "rumours."

The agreement is seen as a significant step towards India's economic growth and its ambition to position Indian manufacturers for significant growth on the global stage. A calibrated approach has been adopted to balance domestic sensitivities while opening new export avenues, de-risking supply chains. The agreement is expected to raise bilateral trade to $500 billion within five to six years.

Minister Piyush Goyal has outlined the broader benefits of expanded global partnerships, emphasizing the need for Indian industries to scale up, diversify raw-material sources, and address domestic concerns about agricultural imports. He noted the importance of Indian industries adapting to new global trade dynamics. In this context, a strategic trade balance and supply chain resilience are considered crucial.

The Indian government has also been promoting strategic disinvestment in public assets, aiming to raise ₹80,000 crore by FY27 through a combination of traditional equity sales and innovative asset-monetisation tools. As part of this effort, IDBI Bank's strategic disinvestment is in its final evaluation stage, with an outcome expected by end-March.

The government's emphasis on upskilling and vocational training is also being highlighted as a means to mitigate the impact of automation on employment. With the growth of the Indian start-up ecosystem and increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, there is a need for a rapid shift towards more skilled and digitally proficient workforce.

The Defence Secretary has clarified the status of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's involvement in the development of the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) stealth fighter prototype. Although HAL may not currently be in the shortlist for building the prototype, the selection process remains ongoing, and HAL's existing order book and limited capacity to start a new production line are factors that may influence the outcome.

Seven public-private consortia have submitted bids to develop the fifth-generation fighter, which will incorporate advanced features such as AI, indigenous radar, and weapon systems. The selection process is based on a detailed technical matrix assessing manpower, equipment, and experience, and the government has allotted a long timeline of seven to eight years for the chosen consortium to complete the project.

Meanwhile, ride-hailing drivers from Ola, Uber, and other platforms have announced a nationwide strike to protest what they perceive as unfair pricing policies. This move is likely to cause potential service disruptions and may prompt regulators and companies to re-examine fare structures.

The Indian government continues to implement policies aimed at boosting economic growth and competitiveness in the face of technological advancements and trade agreements. A recent discussion highlights that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to significantly impact the job market, with entry-level positions being most affected and a shift in job nature expected. India's large talent pool can be leveraged to establish the country as a global AI lab, but the government must swiftly adapt education, vocational training, and skilling programs to meet the changing job market demands.

In a move to offset potential job dislocation and drive economic growth, policies aim to accelerate labor-intensive industries like manufacturing and tourism. Additionally, the government is set to adopt full AI adoption, and build energy-efficient data center infrastructure to support the growth of the tech industry.

Separately, the government has received final bids from potential strategic investors for IDBI Bank's disinvestment. The evaluation and approval phase is underway, with an announcement of the winning bidder expected by the end of March.

In other economic news, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal addressed a press conference on the India-U.S. interim trade agreement. The interim deal includes tariff reductions, quota-based measures, and cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths. Indian exports of U.S. products will benefit from zero-duty or reduced-tariff treatment, with specific sectors receiving preferential treatment.

The agreement also prioritizes digital trade, health, and safety standards cooperation, and quality assurance. Notably, U.S. imports must meet FDA standards, while Indian exports must comply with Indian regulations, such as FSSAI standards. The interim deal aims to deepen bilateral trade, diversify supply chains, and strengthen strategic partnership across multiple sectors.

SBI recently reported record results for Q3 FY26, posting a net profit of ₹21,028 crore and operating profit of ₹32,862 crore.

Domestic credit-deposit ratio stood at 72.98%, and ROE remained strong at 20.68%.

Key takeaways from the Storyboard 18 launch and subsequent discussions are reflected in the evolving landscape of creativity. A grand jury of India's top creative, cultural, and brand leaders has been assembled to judge lasting creativity. Modern advertising, driven by rapid production and algorithmic forces, creates an abundance of content but struggles to achieve lasting impressions.

A key challenge in today's advertising landscape is the need to balance instantaneity and short-lived campaigns with human-centric storytelling. AI is seen as a tool for augmenting creativity, rather than a replacement for idea generation. It is viewed as a means to free up time for deeper craft and exploration of larger societal solutions.

Brands are facing challenges in achieving longevity strategy, with multi-year campaigns becoming a rarity. Attention fragmentation, driven by the proliferation of screens and platforms, further dilutes the impact of any single message. The generational context of ads is also changing, with lasting recall now often depending on cross-generational storytelling.

As a result, creators are looking to revamp classic ads, with some suggesting the remaking of timeless concepts with fresh renditions. The India-US trade deal is another significant development, with the interim agreement lowering effective tariff rates on textiles. This is expected to benefit Indian exporters, particularly those with significant exposure to the US market.

The deal also sets an 18% tariff on auto and auto-components, with exemptions available under Section 232. This is expected to boost sentiment for several Indian automotive firms. Clarification on the tariff structure should improve outlook for these exporters.

The situation with Russian crude is more complex, with India facing a gradual reduction in purchases due to long-term contracts. The U.S. executive order reducing tariffs targets directly Russian-origin oil, making the practical effect dependent on how India restructures its supply chain and navigates existing contracts.

The India-US trade agreement is expected to facilitate the expansion of bilateral trade from the current $45-46 billion to a target of $120 billion by year 5. The deal is seen as a "done deal" and aligns with the recently signed India-EU agreement, giving India parity with neighboring exporters. 

Key sectors that are likely to benefit from the agreement include chemicals, textiles, aircraft parts, auto ancillaries, and food and agri-products. The removal of US tariffs on Indian goods is expected to unlock stagnated markets and provide an immediate upside for certain sectors. The agreement is anticipated to boost exports, reduce inflation due to cheaper energy, and increase earnings growth. 

Experts view the announcement as expected, with no major surprises, and emerging-market funds are likely to re-enter the market quickly. Sentiment is bullish for Indian equities, especially in the sectors directly affected. Companies in the sectors mentioned above are expected to deliver solid earnings growth over the next year, provided supply-chain and labor constraints are managed. 

The agreement serves both economic and geopolitical aims, deepening US-India ties, diversifying supply chains away from China, and securing energy supplies at lower cost. It positions India as a preferred alternative for US brands seeking stable, cost-effective sourcing. 

Additionally, a growth-oriented platform, Nitro Commerce, has secured a $5 million Series A funding led by Cornerstone Ventures. The company aims to provide a third-party alternative to the Meta-Google ad-tech duopoly by aggregating supply and demand for small and medium-sized businesses through AI-powered advertising.

Alphabet's Q4 2025 results demonstrate a significant 18% year-over-year revenue increase to $113.8 billion, accompanied by a 30% profit jump to $34.5 billion. The company's full-year revenue has surpassed $400 billion for the first time, driven largely by the growth engine of AI, which has seen Gemini AI reach 750 million monthly users, with 100 million new users added in the quarter. AI has also been integrated into various search and enterprise tools, further driving record search usage.

Advertising remains the core revenue source, with search ads generating $82.3 billion and YouTube ads contributing $11.4 billion, marking three consecutive quarters of double-digit ad growth. Google Cloud is expanding to meet AI-compute demand, while AI-related capital expenditures have reached $91 billion for 2025, with a planned $175-$185 billion spend in 2026 focused on AI, data centers, and cloud infrastructure.

Investors are experiencing significant returns from AI spending, leading to a $660 billion pledge in AI-related capital expenditures by Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google for 2026. This substantial investment has raised concerns about the return on investment and whether major technology companies must spend heavily to remain competitive.

Market sentiment has taken a downturn, with Microsoft experiencing an 18% decline since the start of the year and software-focused companies like Palantir, ServiceNow, and Salesforce seeing their shares drop by around 30%. This decline has led to concerns about the sustainability of the past three-year tech rally.

Investors are cautious about the future impact of AI, worrying that generative-AI plugins and "anthropic-law" models could bypass traditional software layers, threatening the business and operating models of software-as-a-service and enterprise-software firms. The magnitude of capital expenditures has also raised concerns, with Amazon's guidance of $200 billion for 2026 capex and the combined $650 billion AI-related spend by the four major companies raising doubts about the pace and profitability of these investments.

The Indian IT services sector is likely to be affected by these developments, with potential revenue deflation and delayed client decisions slowing the recovery of FY-26 earnings. Large Indian IT firms risk being trapped in modest mid-single-digit growth unless they reposition themselves as integrators that embed AI models into enterprise workflows.

The tech sector is navigating a sharp correction, driven by uncertainty over AI's long-term impact and massive capex commitments. This correction has spill-over effects on Indian IT services, which hinge on their ability to act as the integration layer between AI models and enterprise operations.
