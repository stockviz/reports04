It is noted that his prolific 2023, marked by four varied releases, has helped to prevent pressure and overexposure. The diversity of roles has allowed Rao to approach each character with research and fear-driven effort.

Rajkumar Rao emphasizes the importance of storytelling in film marketing, highlighting the power of trailers and music in captivating audiences and generating interest. He notes that nostalgia-driven songs are particularly effective in this regard. Additionally, Rao suggests that branding strategies should prioritize equity partnerships, especially in sectors such as health and trustworthy food.

The actor also shares his experience as a producer at Camper Films, where he is committed to backing unconventional, writer-driven projects such as the Netflix original *Toaster*. Rao emphasizes the importance of supporting fresh talent and giving writers sufficient time to develop their stories.

On the topic of global ambitions, Rajkumar Rao prefers to export Indian stories rather than relocating abroad. He distinguishes between OTT and cinema, noting that while longer screen time allows for deeper character development, the core acting process remains the same. However, he suggests that writing is the bigger challenge for series.

Rao reflects on his journey from theater to film, asserting that both cinema and OTT will coexist. He believes that theaters will persist due to their unique communal experience. Looking ahead, the actor plans to work on various projects, including the raw-action film *Malik*, the Netflix project *Toaster*, and other undisclosed ventures.

In a separate press conference, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal addressed journalists and industry representatives regarding the India-U.S. interim trade agreement. Key developments include significant tariff reductions or zero-duty treatment on a wide range of U.S. products, including spices, coffee, coconut oil, fruits, processed foods, and generic drugs.

The agreement also introduces quota-based measures, which allow certain sectors to operate under universal duty elimination. Additionally, there is an emphasis on cooperation with the U.S. on critical minerals, particularly in the wake of China's export restrictions.

The press conference touched on various specific questions and answers, covering topics such as import limits for apple and DDGS, aircraft parts, auto parts, precious metals, strawberries, and pesticides. It was highlighted that exporters must meet both Indian and U.S. safety standards for their produce.

SuperHealth's founders - Varun Dubey, Dr. Alex, and Manoj - aim to address chronic hospital problems in India, including opaque pricing, unreliable appointments, and excessive costs. Their model tackles these issues by leasing land, using rapid and low-cost construction, offering fixed-salary doctor compensation, and providing transparent pricing.

The Storyboard 18 Awards have launched with a grand jury of India's top creative, cultural, and brand leaders, who will judge lasting creativity. The panel highlights the difficulty of creating memorable ads in a modern advertising landscape characterized by instant, algorithm-driven, and short-lived content.

The panelists agree that great work still exists, but its lifespan in the cultural zeitgeist is dramatically shorter. AI is seen as a speed-up for repetitive tasks, but not a replacement for idea generation. Creatives treat AI as a utility to free time for deeper craft and explore larger societal solutions.

Attention fragmentation, lack of longevity strategy, and generational context contribute to the fading of good ads. The industry desires to revive classics, but acknowledges that lasting recall now often depends on cross-generational storytelling.

The interim India-US trade deal lowers the effective tariff on textiles to about 18%, benefiting Indian exporters, particularly firms with significant exposure to the US market. This reduction could increase India's market share in US ready-made garment imports.

It is noted that India cannot instantly halt Russian crude purchases despite the recent global tensions, with the contracts signed months in advance leading to a gradual reduction in imports. Notably, one Indian refinery still entirely relies on Russian crude, and the decline in overall Russian oil imports has yet to reach zero.

A recent U.S. executive order has reduced tariffs on Indian goods to 25% and warned of reinstating duties if Russia oil purchases resume. The order specifically targets oil products of Russian origin, and its practical impact will depend on how India restructures its supply chain and navigates existing contracts. The situation is viewed as a temporary adjustment rather than a permanent shift.

An interim India-US trade deal is expected to channel approximately $500 billion of U.S. goods into India over the next five years, benefiting various sectors. Key beneficiaries include textiles, leather, and aerospace industries, while auto ancillary and generic pharma sectors also experience positive sentiment. Moreover, organic chemicals, home décor, and capital goods are also expected to benefit from this deal.

Tariff changes under this agreement include zero-tariff access for many sectors, as well as section 32 exemption benefits for aerospace and auto parts. However, section 232 tariff reductions on U.S. imports such as dry distillery grains and red sorghum may have negative impacts on domestic wine manufacturers. The deal also creates positive outlooks for datacentre and networking equipment, as well as agri and dairy/FMCG sectors. The broader deal is expected to create upside potential for various listed stocks and sector groups, with finer details of the agreements still awaited.

Several developments in the technology and business sectors are being closely watched. Nitro Commerce, a platform for India's digital consumer market, has secured $5 million in funding for its AI-driven growth platform. With a focus on high-intent advertising, the company aims to position itself as a third-party alternative to Meta and Google ad-tech services. Key priorities include further integration with supply partners and development of agentic AI for personalized, low-intrusive advertising.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's fourth-quarter results revealed an 18% year-over-year revenue increase to $113.8 billion. The company's AI growth engine, Gemini AI, has reached 750 million monthly users, with significant ad growth contributing to its success. Google Cloud is expanding to meet AI-compute demand, with AI-related capital expenditure planned at $175-$185 billion for 2026.

Investors are cautious, with concerns raised over AI's long-term impact and massive capital expenditures. Software-focused companies have seen significant declines, with Microsoft's share price falling around 18%. The broader tech rally is being corrected, and investors are concerned about the pace and profitability of these investments. The implications for Indian IT services are being closely watched, with potential revenue deflation and delayed client decisions possible.

The Cognizant CEO believes AI benefits are contextual and require IT services to bridge models and business processes. Other analysts are more cautious, anticipating continued growth pressure, valuation corrections, and a selective investment approach. The tech sector is navigating a sharp correction, driven by uncertainty over AI's long-term impact and massive capex commitments.

Key Developments Emerging from Global Markets and Indian Economy

A U.S. Treasury Secretary's statement has highlighted the significance of diplomatic talks in resolving the Ukraine war, with potential new sanctions on Russia dependent on the outcome. Existing sanctions have already put pressure on Moscow, and additional measures such as targeting Russia's "shadow fleet" are being considered.

Simultaneously, a voice-first social network called "Friend" is gaining traction in small-town India, focusing on real-time conversation in users' native languages while offering one-on-one rooms and group chats. The app prioritizes users' safety, utilizing features such as voice verification and screen protection. Friend has secured backing from notable investors and aims to double its annual revenue to ₹100 million within a year.

The Indian market has seen significant activity, with the Nifty and Sensex experiencing a 3.5% and 1.5% increase, respectively. Large-cap winners include Power Grid, Adani Enterprises, and Adani Ports, while defence-related stocks saw declines. The global tech market was marked by a sharp downturn, with fears of AI's potential to erode traditional software models and render massive capital expenditures unprofitable.

As a result, major US and Indian IT firms experienced a steep decline, driven by concerns over the impact of AI on their revenue streams. Sandeep Tandon, a portfolio manager, has adjusted his exposure to various sectors, citing India's relative outperformance over developed markets and his expectations for continued robust growth. Notably, India's fundamentals, particularly in the private banking, insurance, and asset management sectors, provide a basis for optimism.

However, the IT and defence sectors remain cautious, pending valuation corrections, while precious metals have been trimmed in anticipation of data-driven reassessments. Furthermore, a recent AI advancement by Anthropic has sparked fears of disintermediation across the legal-software and data-services sectors, resulting in a sharp sell-off of stocks such as ServiceNow, Salesforce, and Accenture.

A pre-summit discussion on the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi highlights the India-US trade deal's positive impact on AI investments in the region. The trade deal eliminates tariff uncertainty, paving the way for increased US-India AI investments, such as Google's $15 billion commitment, and deeper business-to-business collaboration on AI supply-chain development. This cooperation is expected to result in a secure and resilient AI supply chain, with both countries sharing expertise rather than attempting to create costly frontier models from scratch.

The agenda of the AI Impact Summit shifts from safety to implementation and inclusive impact, giving the Global South a stronger voice. Discussions on AI-enabled threats, such as offensive cyber tools and deep-fakes, are still insufficient, cautioning that low-cost AI from authoritarian sources could pose long-term risks for developing nations. India is urged to focus on leveraging existing global models for national-security use cases, investing in AI security capabilities, and edge-deployment for sensitive applications.

The US and China dominate foundational AI development, with India, Europe, and other regions balancing sovereign ambitions with rapid adoption of existing technologies to avoid a widening gap. A strong, growing US-India defense partnership is envisioned, with AI enhancing border security, energy-system resilience, threat detection, and rapid response. The cooperation is essential, as adversaries will also exploit AI, making security safeguards critical.

The Indian government has also launched Bharat Taxi, a cooperative-led ride-hailing platform, which offers a search-free, zero-commission model with drivers keeping 100% of fares and passengers paying up to 30% less than on competing platforms. The service integrates with public transport and offers drivers social-security benefits, allowing them to work on other platforms. Initiatives like "Bayak Didi" promote women drivers and give drivers a formal voice in decision-making.

The Indian stock market experienced a positive close for the second consecutive week, with the Nifty 50 and Sensex recording gains. However, IT stocks, including Cognizant, declined significantly amid concerns over a potential slowdown in revenue due to the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).

Amazon has announced a substantial AI capex plan for 2026, totaling $200 billion, bringing the combined AI expenditure of Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon to $660 billion. The significant investment has resulted in a sell-off of U.S. software stocks, with Microsoft plummeting by approximately 18% year-to-date, while Palantir, ServiceNow, and Salesforce dropped by about 30%. Analysts are divided on whether the immense spending is necessary for survival or will yield returns on investment.

The Indian IT industry is under pressure due to the AI-driven tech rout, potentially leading to delayed projects and compressed FY-26 earnings recovery for Indian IT service firms. Cognizant's CEO emphasized that AI is valuable only when embedded in enterprise workflows, positioning Indian IT firms as "bridge" providers. Brokerages are split, with Kotak viewing the current situation as overblown panic, while Jefferies expects selective growth and valuation corrections.

The U.S. job market experienced a significant decline in January, with over 100,000 jobs eliminated, the largest monthly layoff wave since the 2008 crisis. While AI was cited as a factor in only about 7% of the layoffs, contract losses, economic conditions, and restructuring were major contributing factors.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained the repo rate at 5.25%, with all six Monetary Policy Committee members voting to pause. The inflation outlook was revised upward by 10 basis points to 2.1% for FY-26, with the RBI expecting headline inflation to exceed 4% by October. The growth forecast for the fiscal year was raised to 7.4%.

RBI abstained from fresh sovereign-debt purchases, resulting in a rise in 10-year yields to 6.75%. The rupee depreciated approximately 30% year-over-year but gained about 1.5% this week on expectations of an India-U.S. trade deal-driven upside.

Additionally, RBI introduced several non-policy measures, including the doubling of collateral-free loan limits for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to ₹20 lakh, permitting banks to lend to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and drafting a framework for compensating digital-fraud victims up to ₹25,000.

Negotiations between India and the United States on a trade deal have progressed, excluding rice, wheat, soy, corn, sugar, and dairy products to protect Indian farmers.

India's crude imports from Russia dropped by 33% year-over-year, dipping below 25% of total oil imports. Talks between the United States and Iran in Muscat aim to avert war, with Iran seeking a "fair" nuclear agreement.

Monetary policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have been deemed stable, with the repo rate held at 5.25% by all six MPC members. This decision is attributed to a "Goldilocks" scenario, where growth is strong and inflation is contained. The RBI has also upgraded the growth outlook to 7.4% for FY 2024-25, and raised the inflation estimate to 2.1%, predicting it to breach 4% by October.

The market reaction to these measures has been moderate, with sovereign bond yields rising to 6.75%, and the rupee weakening, but recovering slightly to close near 96.5 USD. The Nifty index has ended above 25,650, with the Mid-Cap index up around 2%, and the Bank Nifty up around 1.5%. Conversely, the IT index has seen a decline of around 7% weekly, while the FMCG sector has rallied, and realty has seen a rise of around 5%.

The RBI has also announced several consumer-protection measures, including the drafting of guidelines on mis-selling, the harmonisation of recovery-agent rules, and the limitation of customer liability for digital fraud to ₹25,000. Additionally, banks will now be able to extend collateral-free MSME loans up to ₹20 lakh.

Negotiations on the US-India trade deal are progressing, with agriculture being excluded. It is expected that a joint statement and tariff reduction to 18% will be announced next week. India aims to increase US imports from $300 billion to $500 billion over the next five years, with a focus on oil, gas, aircraft, laptops, smartphones, and data-center gear.

A review of 754 aircraft over 13 months has shown that 50% of the aircraft have repetitive defects, with Air India's fleet being flagged at 82%, and Indigo's at 36%. However, the government has yet to clarify whether these defects are safety-critical or non-critical.

The RBI has also refrained from making fresh sovereign-bond purchases, and announced a digital-fraud compensation framework. Russia's share of India's oil imports has fallen to less than 25% in December, down 33% from the previous month.

Several notable funding highlights have been reported, including AI voice-generation startup 11 Labs raising $500 million at a valuation of $11 billion, and robotics NDT startup Octobotics securing a seed round of ~₹10 crore. Other funded companies include marine-robotics firm Irov, and e-commerce platform Naika, which has posted over 20% QoQ revenue growth for 13 consecutive quarters.

India's Supreme Court has declared menstrual health a fundamental right under Article 21, mandating the provision of free sanitary pads, functional toilets, and dignity for schoolgirls.

The RBI's monetary policy measures have been accompanied by various funding rounds, including a Series-A of $5 million for NitroCommerce, a full-stack AI-driven growth engine for SMBs. The company offers an integrated advertising platform that aggregates demand-supply across partners and uses "agent-K.I." for hyper-personalized ads.

PhysicsWallah, a test-preparation firm, is shifting its focus to K-12 schooling, aiming to make it a larger profit driver than test prep within five years. The company has earmarked ₹400 crore for its K-12 platform, Pen Pencil, which will pursue a mix of partnerships, greenfield/brownfield schools, and full-management models like Tender Heart School. This strategy mirrors Chinese models where K-12 outpaces test prep in revenue.

Recent FY26 results show 34% YoY revenue growth to ₹1,082 crore and a 9% net margin, with online and offline streams each accounting for roughly half of total revenue. The company's K-12 segment currently contributes less than 1% of its revenue but is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.

A notable Indian plywood manufacturer, Century Plyboards, has reported solid Q3 growth, with revenue up approximately 18% YoY, driven by segment growth in plywood, laminates, MDF, and particle board. The company's balance sheet is healthy, with a net-worth and debt-to-equity ratio of around 0.3-0.4, and cash of around ₹70 crore.

Century Plyboards is expanding its capacity, targeting an additional 70,000 m³ MDF capacity in FY27, and has invested ₹1,100 crore in a new greenfield unit in Uttar Pradesh. The company's share price has appreciated by 190% over the past five years, but has remained relatively stable in the last year. Analysts expect a 13% upside in the next 12 months.

Germinate Investor Services' founder, Santosh Joseph, believes that small-cap funds remain attractive despite recent volatility. Joseph notes that small-cap funds surged for several years after COVID, delivering outsized returns, but have entered a corrective phase over the past 12-14 months. He advises investors to stay disciplined, keep SIPs active, and consider fresh allocations to small-cap funds.

Joseph suggests investors look at fund size, manager track record, and style when selecting small-cap funds. Diversifying across a few small-cap funds with different approaches can help mitigate risk. The current environment offers a better entry point than a year-and-a-half ago, provided investors maintain a long-term perspective and diversified small-cap exposure.

Investors can consider ICICI Prudential's small-cap fund, which has recently reopened lump-sum inflows, signaling confidence in the sector. This fund offers a mid-range AUM of ₹5-15 billion, balancing active stock-picking ability with manageable constraints.

Physics Wallah's co-founder, Pratik Maheshwari, has outlined the company's performance, new initiatives, and AI outlook. The company achieved its FY target nine months ahead of schedule and is projecting growth in Q4. The revenue cycle is upfront-fee based, resulting in a predictable but negative-cash-flow business model.

Maheshwari highlights several new initiatives, including Vishwas Divas, a strong state-board enrollment program, and Pi, a subscription-based OTT platform, which is gaining traction. Additionally, PW Talk, an English-learning app, has reached $1 M ARR. The company is expanding its reach in state boards and southern India.

Regarding AI, Maheshwari views it as an opportunity to enhance teacher efficiency, enable hyper-personalized learning, and power the company's own Ed-LLM and proprietary AI-generated question papers/books. AI is expected to support the company's scaling without massive hiring, augmenting teachers rather than replacing them.

Indian cigarette stocks, ITC and Godfrey Phillips, have recently experienced price hikes, which are anticipated to protect top-line growth and offset volume declines. Analysts remain bullish on these stocks, citing pricing strength, a stable tax environment, and diversified business segments as support for future growth.

The Civil Aviation Ministry has announced findings of audits on Indian airline aircraft, discovering repetitive defects in approximately 50% of aircraft across several airlines. However, the ministry does not clarify whether these defects are safety-critical or non-critical.

LIC's Q3 FY26 results were driven by margin improvements due to business-mix improvement, favorable economic assumptions, and a stronger yield curve. However, operating assumptions on VNB (value of new business) were negative, pulling down margins. The company's margins would have been considerably lower without the positive economic variance.

Indian markets have been in a 16-month consolidation phase, characterized by uncertainty over the Indo-US trade deal. However, the negative sentiment has eased after the deal's finalisation, allowing the currency to stabilise around the 90-level. Earnings growth is expected to rebound to the mid-teens over the next 12-15 months, with BFSI/NBFCs and premium consumer segments leading the way. Technology, including AI, presents chances at lower valuations, with a further 10-12% pull-back potentially offering tactical buying opportunities.

FMC Corp.'s India crop-protection business is being evaluated for potential acquisition by multiple Indian firms, including UPL, Dhanuka Agritech, Coromandel International, and Crystal Crop Protection. The asset, classified as "held for sale," comprises branded products, a sales and distribution network, and established farmer relationships. Sources estimate the deal could be worth around $450 million, with the valuation and structure still being worked out.

SBI's Q3 FY26 earnings are expected to show strong loan book growth of about 13% YoY, driven by demand for credit. Deposit growth is anticipated to reach near 10% YoY. Net interest income is expected to rise by 8%, but profit growth is forecasted to be modest at 4% due to a likely sharp increase in provisions.

Indian equities showed mixed performance, with losers including Tech Mahindra, HDFC Life, SBI Life, TCS, and Wipro. Gainers included ITC, Kotak Bank, Bharti, HUL, and Bajaj Finance. The market is expected to stabilize before investors can consider adding long positions.

Precious metals are slightly positive after a turbulent week, but further downside is anticipated. Gold could dip to INR 42-43 k per 10 g, and silver may fall 5-10%. The US dollar index remains weak, and the euro, pound, Swiss franc, and even the rupee appear to be bottoming around 88-89 USD.

Commodities often rally late in equity bull markets, and distressed assets in agriculture are near 10-15-year lows. Copper has corrected sharply, despite AI-driven demand, and structural deficits remain. A long-cycle position in copper could be entered once markets calm. Bitcoin is anticipated to see a 50% correction, targeting ₹125-63 k. Retail long liquidations are pending, and altcoins face sharper declines.

Nykaa's Q3 FY26 results showed strong performance, with overall revenue up 27% driven by 27% beauty GMV growth and 31% fashion GMV growth. EBITDA jumped 63%, lifting the margin from 6.2% to 8%. Net profit rose about 160% to ₹68 crore.

In the broader market, a recovery is underway, especially in mid- and small-cap stocks, driven by a shift from large-cap exposure by domestic mutual funds and buying from large financial institutions in metals and PSU banks. Earnings-driven moves include a sharp 12-13% rise in Hitachi after a short-cover rally and a valuation boost for Elisha. FMCG gains are led by ITC and related cigarette stocks.

Bharti Airtel's expectation of a large block sale soon is due to promoters being restricted from selling shares for 48 hours post-earnings. A strategic investor may offload shares. The market is cautious about job cuts in the US, with over 1.8 million job cuts announced in January, double the previous year and the highest monthly total since the 2009 recession. Hiring intentions fell to the lowest January figure recorded since tracking began in 2009.

The stock market snapshot reveals a relatively stable trend, with the Nifty hovering around 25,600 and gaining approximately 16 points.

The Analyst Panel responds to viewer queries, providing insights into the current positions and outlook of various stocks. Keynes Technology is considered overvalued, with revenue and profit misses, and Chinese competition risk. It is recommended to book half of the profits and hold the remaining for long-term upside potential. Keynes Technology's support levels are expected around ₹3,200-₹3,300.

Signed TLM is viewed as a hold, with weak earnings and cost-write-offs impacting profit in the recent quarter. The company is expected to improve in the next fiscal years due to new defence logos. Strong support is anticipated near ₹330. GNFC is considered very cheap, with a strong balance sheet and expansion plans, making it a long-term hold. GSK Pharma is viewed as a multinational with solid balance sheet and steady return potential, also a long-term hold.

Tata Technologies faces a disappointing Q3, with modest growth outlook and pricey valuation. A medium-term consolidation is expected, with neutral rating for long-term investors. The near-term support is expected around ₹605, with a potential fall to ₹586-₹600 if broken. Patanjali Foods shows a post-bonus-issue correction, but the company is targeting 12-13% revenue growth byFY27. Support is expected around ₹480, with a target of ₹560-₹580 for positional traders.

IEX displays a potential long-term growth due to Indian electricity-trading share being low. The company's Q4 volumes are up 16%, with power-trading volumes increasing 80-90% YoY, and cash-flow remaining strong. BAML incurs a net loss of ₹22 crore and missed on profit and margins.

The Analyst Panel suggests considering partial profit-taking and waiting for a better entry for overvalued stocks with earnings misses. A hold-or-average-down strategy is recommended for cheap, fundamentally sound names, as well as companies with long-term tailwinds. Technical support levels are highlighted for each ticker, with breakouts above key resistance triggering short-term buying and breaches of support warranting exits.

Air India's $400 million fleet-modernisation programme is facing supply-chain bottlenecks, especially with aircraft seats and certification, resulting in a two-year delay. The programme remains on budget, with the first upgraded aircraft expected to enter service by March 2026.

RBI's new policy allows banks to lend directly to REITs, rather than their special purpose vehicles, thereby providing the sector with longer-term, lower-cost financing and greater credit access. This move is expected to improve capital stability, diversify funding sources, and enable REITs to make more acquisitions, as evidenced by Mindspace Business Parks REIT's decreased cost of capital and increased use of fixed-rate debt.

The policy announcement follows earlier reforms on equity classification, pension-fund investment, and sponsor ratings, and aligns with the government's proposal to recycle public-sector assets through REITs. This is expected to further boost the market, as REITs will have greater access to capital and be able to finance more projects.

Meanwhile, ABB sees India making significant strides in its energy transition, driven by government will, growing demand for e-mobility, data centers, and industrial electrification. The company provides products for specific industries while supporting the whole value chain through power-generation and distribution optimization.

ABB is focused on decarbonisation and low-carbon fuels, including hydrogen for steel, green ammonia, and other heavy-process applications. The Indian government is increasingly receptive to addressing peak-demand challenges and integrating generation, transmission, and demand-side measures.

The company is already seeing measurable gains from the use of artificial intelligence, with efficiency improvements and reduced start-up times in power plants. ABB plans to expand its digital portfolio, leveraging global R&D to deliver locally-adapted solutions.

ABB views green hydrogen as a high-potential fuel for industrial decarbonisation and long-haul mobility, with the potential to overcome production cost and infrastructure challenges. India's abundant renewable energy gives it a strategic advantage in this area.

The company emphasizes the need for continued investment in capabilities, skills, and technology transfer, which is expected to drive growth and export opportunities. ABB remains a local supplier adapting to market changes and is focused on boosting energy-efficiency and automation, strengthening AI-driven optimisation, and accelerating green-hydrogen projects.

In a separate development, Alberta's Minister of Indigenous Relations highlights the importance of energy security and diversification, with the province aiming to expand exports to India and other Asian markets. The minister also emphasizes the need to ensure reliable and ethically produced energy, and to address climate goals and the energy transition.

Alberta's production is presented as environmentally responsible, and the province ranks 9th globally in natural-gas reserves and 4th in crude oil. Key products for India include LNG, LPG, heavy oil, and pulses, with a new pipeline to the northwest coast planned to serve Asian markets.

The province is also investing in ground-level work and education to facilitate regulatory approvals and community partnerships, rather than large cash outlays. This will help secure approvals for a new pipeline, grant Indigenous communities equity stakes, and establish long-term agreements with India.

LIC's third-quarter results call revealed a 61% year-over-year increase in retail annualized premium, with the overall share of new business standing at 36.8%, a stable figure compared to the previous quarter. Retail premium growth is expected to continue, driven by a focus on improving product and channel mix. The VNB margin for the 9-month period stands at 18.8%, up 100 basis points from the previous fiscal year's 17.8%. A margin of approximately 21% was achieved in the third quarter, and management expects similar performance in the fourth quarter, potentially lifting the fiscal year 2025 VNB margin to around 19-19.5%.

Product mix improvements, including the growth of higher-margin non-par and bancassurance business, along with expense ratio rationalization, have driven the increase in VNB margin. The company continues to focus on shifting its product and channel mix toward higher margin products and increasing bancassurance contribution. Logistics challenges in expanding these high-margin products are mitigated by a strong local presence and extensive port infrastructure in India.

Expense management has been a continuous effort for LIC, with recent input-tax credit issues adding strain. However, management expects these issues to be mitigated, limiting similar large variances in future expense ratios. The company has also seen a higher GST burden than anticipated due to the remaining intermediated side, though management expects some reversal or optimization before the end of the year.

Assumption variances of -280 basis points, primarily due to expense and withdrawal assumptions, along with 190 basis points of benefit from yield-curve movements, have impacted LIC's current fiscal year results. Management believes that improved expense control and expense ratio rationalization will limit similar large variances in the future. With a target above fiscal year 2024's 17.8% margin, LIC expects modest, continuous improvement in VNB margins and expense efficiency throughout fiscal year 2025.

SLB has highlighted its 93-year legacy in India during the India Energy Week 2026 on the ONDC campus in Goa, showcasing its discovery of Goa's first oil. The event emphasized the continued importance of oil and gas in meeting the planet's energy demands. In another development, a CNBC TV18 video has presented a key analysis of India's 2026 Union Budget, featuring insights from policymakers and experts.

The RBI's press conference and panel discussion revealed that the central authority will maintain its repo rate and focus on transmitting the rate to the broader market. Liquidity management will continue to be handled on a case-by-case basis, and large-scale liquidity infusions are unlikely through March due to the surplus liquidity amounting to approximately ₹4.46 lakh crore. The bond market reacted with hardened yields following the meeting, as no OMO or CRR cut was announced.

The RBI anticipates 10-year G-sec yields around 6.9-7.0 percent by March, with the short end staying anchored and the long end facing upward pressure from global factors. Worldwide fixed-income markets are facing headwinds, including higher inflation expectations and mixed central-bank cycles, which are likely to keep Indian yields on a modest upward trajectory over the next 6-12 months.

India's government borrowing has increased to approximately ₹17.2 trillion in FY 2023-24, with yields dropping from around 7.8 percent to 6.7 percent, indicating strong market appetite. The RBI is targeting approximately ₹16.3 trillion in net borrowing via buybacks. The Monetary Policy Committee remains in a pause mode, awaiting further growth stimuli from the government through budget reforms and trade deals.

Astral's CFO, Hiranam Savlani, revealed that the company's volumes rose 16.8 percent in Q3 and are expected to improve further in Q4, driven by increased polymer prices and genuine demand. The firm holds low-cost inventory, which should boost Q4 margins, and Q4 historically delivers peak volumes, resulting in an economies-of-scale advantage. For FY 27, Astral expects better margins and continued double-digit top-line growth, driven by the recovery of polymer prices and the growth of its other businesses, including adhesives and paints, bathware, and plumbing.

Realizations are expected to recover from Q4 onward as pricing improves, and the revenue mix outlook indicates that plumbing will account for approximately 67-68 percent of sales, while other businesses will contribute approximately 33-35 percent.

Market analysts expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to raise policy rates by about 1 percentage point in the next 6-9 months due to massive fiscal borrowing. The central bank, however, has limited levers to offset the debt-driven pressure on yields. Key sectors such as real-estate and rate-sensitive sectors have already faced significant impacts, while equity markets have been pricing in higher rates, resulting in lower valuations. Commodity markets have seen high margins, but investors are facing squeezed returns due to regulatory moves.

Indian IT firms, particularly Cognizant, face criticism for low reinvestment and high dividend payouts, with management identified as a key weakness. Consumer staples are deemed over-valued with weak growth, making them unattractive at current price-to-earnings levels. On the other hand, attractive long-term themes have been identified, including auto and auto-ancillaries, mining (non-ferrous metals), healthcare (hospitals), stock-exchange monopoly, and precious metals (gold, silver).

Cognizant's CEO, S. Ravi Kumar, has stated that the hype around AI is overstated, emphasizing the need for contextually engineered and integrated solutions. The company has posted 6.4% revenue growth and 11% EPS growth in FY 2023, meeting its guidance. For FY 2026, Cognizant targets 4-6.5% constant-currency revenue growth, including $150 billion of inorganic contributions.

Kain's Technology aims to achieve ₹1,700 crore revenue in Q4, which would bring FY-26 revenue to about ₹4,100 crore, with a 16% EBITDA margin. However, the company's original FY revenue guidance of ₹4,500 crore has been revised downward due to deliberate product postponements. The working-capital cycle is being trimmed, and the company is expected to become operating-cash-positive by year-end. Management believes a 40-45% CAGR can be sustained through FY 28/29, driven by the board-business pipeline and high-tech EMS opportunities.

Hitachi Energy has reported strong third-quarter results, with revenue and profit experiencing significant increases. The company's margins stood at 16.6%, marking the second consecutive quarter of double-digit margins. Management has expressed confidence in the sustainability of the margin level, although a specific forward-looking figure has not been provided. A substantial portion of the portfolio now includes price-escalation clauses, enabling the company to pass commodity-price inflation onto customers with minimal impact on earnings.

Competition from Chinese manufacturers remains a risk, but Hitachi Energy expects a level-playing field and notes that most of its production is localized, reducing supply-chain exposure. A significant order backlog provides support for revenue growth and margin expansion. HVDC is a core growth driver, particularly for "air-ready" data centers that require rapid, large-scale power swings. Hitachi Energy estimates that 10-15% of global data-center capex is addressable for its solutions.

The company highlights its end-to-end capabilities, encompassing power-system studies, grid connection, and advanced technologies for high-density, AI-driven data centers. New cooling technologies hold the potential to reduce data-center power demand, although management views this as a disruption yet to be validated. Overall, Hitachi Energy is betting on continued margin strength, localized production, and expanding opportunities in HVDC and data-center power infrastructure.

In another development, VA Tech CFO Babak Sitaraman highlighted a quarter of strong, profitable growth driven by higher-margin international and industrial projects, disciplined fixed-cost control, and effective cash-and-debt management. The company posted a net cash balance exceeding ₹1,000 crore and reduced working-capital days to ~100. With an order book of about ₹16,000 crore, the firm aims for 15-20% YoY growth and a consistent ₹1,000 crore-per-quarter revenue run rate.

Market volatility has affected Indian and regional markets, with India experiencing relative stability despite the fluctuations seen in Hong Kong, China, and Korea. Positive sentiment in India is partly driven by an emerging India-U.S. trade deal. Small-cap earnings are strong, with approximately 39% YoY growth, while the stock market has displayed a disconnect between earnings momentum and market pricing.

Select sector opportunities are identified, including basic materials and base metals, industrials, financials, and consumer discretionary, which are deemed attractive due to rising earnings estimates and improving policy shifts. However, tech and IT services are viewed with caution, given the uncertainty surrounding AI-driven transformation. Generative-AI is creating deflationary pressure on Indian IT services, potentially leading to a compression of earnings and downward revisions of EPS forecasts. As a result, valuation multiples for Indian IT stocks are being de-rated, and investors are cautious about buying on the current dip.

Market dynamics have led to a correction, with various factors contributing to the decline. A significant sell-off is observed in tech and AI-related stocks, following Microsoft's large capital expenditure announcement, which has heightened concerns about returns on software spending. The NASDAQ has slipped approximately 6% in three days, raising questions about a deeper correction. Broader market unease extends beyond tech to crypto, driven by fears of reduced liquidity as the new Federal Reserve Chair, Kevin Warsh, is expected to adopt a hawkish stance on inflation and begin shrinking the Fed's balance sheet.

A tighter monetary environment could force deleveraging, hitting highly leveraged crypto positions hardest. Market participants anticipate a correction after the year-long rally, with the timing possibly being this spring, but the magnitude is uncertain. The appointment of Warsh is seen as a move toward restoring the Fed's traditional focus on price stability, full employment, and banking safety, limiting "mission creep" and potentially calming markets over the medium-to-long term.

Commodities and cryptocurrencies are also experiencing a downturn, with gold, silver, and platinum declining significantly. The dollar index has risen, while cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have dropped substantially, trading below their all-time highs. Indian markets have underperformed due to a weak rupee, but recent diplomatic outreach and a pending US-India trade deal may improve sentiment.

Financial institutions are cautiously bullish on the Indian market, with data indicating that they are covering shorts and adding longs, accompanied by aggressive call-writing that has lowered the put-call ratio. Key support levels for the Nifty futures are 25,450 (20-DMA) and 59,400 on Nifty Bank. The day's focal points are the RBI policy and the India-US trade deal, which are expected to influence market dynamics.

Asian markets have opened with a decline, with Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Shanghai experiencing losses. 

India's Nifty is expected to gap down by approximately 100 points, opening near 25,500-25,600. The key resistance level is at 25,750-25,800, while the support level is at 25,500. The index has formed lower highs since a 1,200-point rally on Wednesday, with several heavyweights that previously supported Nifty now pulling it down.

The RBI's monetary policy meeting will be a critical driver for the market, particularly for Nifty Bank, which is defending the 60,000 level with crucial support at 59,400-59,500. FII activity has flipped to selling after two days of buying, offloading approximately 2,150 crore in cash and cutting futures purchases.

Earnings from various Indian companies have been mixed, with Bharti Airtel and Tata Motors PV reporting declines in their profit margins. In contrast, companies such as Hitachi Energy and Ms Mascow Dock reported significant increases in their revenue and profit margins. 

The F&O flow indicates that put writers are active around 25,600, while call writers are active around 25,700, indicating an expected range of 25,500-25,800. The 100-day MA sits between the 20- and 50-day MAs, supporting the same range.

Market sentiment has changed with the post-US-India trade-deal rally fading, and short-covering tapering off. Longs are being added on stocks such as NICA, Jubilant Foodworks, and Page Industries, contributing to the downside bias.

State Bank of India is expected to post a 5% year-over-year increase in its Q3FY26 net profit, driven by loan growth in retail, agriculture, small-business, and personal loans. Analysts forecast loan growth of 13-14% year-over-year, while corporate capex remains muted.

Aye Finance, a VC-backed microlender, is launching an IPO at a valuation of approximately 3,200 crore, slightly below its 2025 Series G round. The company aims to bolster its Tier-I capital to fund growth for the next 2-3 years, targeting a loan book of 15-16 trillion.

The NBFC sector is expected to see modest profitability improvement only by FY2026-27 due to rising bad loans and asset-quality concerns. In contrast, AI startups are poised to disrupt India's 283 billion dollar IT services sector, focusing on three segments: building new applications, software implementation, and application-maintenance automation.

Markets experienced a decline, with the Nifty and Sensex dipping by over 0.5% after a three-day rally, closing below 25,700. The broader indices showed a slight improvement, but IT stocks suffered a downturn due to worries about AI disruption, particularly following the launch of Anthropic's new automation tools. This led to a sharp sell-off in global software stocks, resulting in approximately $285 billion in market value being erased in a single day.

The RBI is expected to keep policy rates unchanged in the upcoming meeting, with around 90% of poll respondents anticipating this decision. Analysts are focusing on liquidity management rather than rate changes, with a single 25-bp cut being projected by around 30% of respondents.

Corporate earnings reports were mixed, with Tata Motors posting a Q3 loss due to a cyber-attack on JLR and soft Chinese demand, while Bharti Airtel recorded 4% sequential revenue growth and a 30-bp margin expansion.

Commodity prices also experienced a downturn, with silver plummeting by around 13% after a brief rebound, and Bitcoin falling below $70,000 for the first time in 14 months, with the crypto market cap slipping below $2.4 trillion.

The Indian government has taken steps to increase global confidence in India's stability through the signing of the first tranche of the India-US trade deal, which is expected to be signed by mid-March and will result in an 18% tariff cut on Indian goods. The deal is seen as a boost to India's economic stability.

In recent geopolitical developments, US President Trump and China's Xi Jinping discussed various topics, including Taiwan, Iran, and Russia-Ukraine, during a meeting. Additionally, talks between the US and Iran are set to take place in Oman, mediated by Qatar, Turkey, and Egypt, in an effort to resolve their long-standing issues.

Lastly, Indian Railways punctuality has decreased from 90% to 73% over the past year, and Home Minister Amit Shah has launched a new cooperative ride-hailing platform called "Bharat Taxi" in Delhi NCR and Gujarat, aiming to compete with established companies like Uber and Ola.

Anthropic's launch of Claude CoWork, a plug-in-rich digital colleague that can read files, organize folders, and draft documents, has sparked fears of AI replacing traditional software products and outsourcing models, resulting in a sharp sell-off in global software stocks valued at $285 billion.

A shift toward internal AI-driven workflow automation is being signaled by the tool being embedded in existing enterprise platforms, rather than being sold standalone. However, concerns about the impact of AI on the software industry are being downplayed by some experts. CP Gurnani sees the Anthropic move as the first large-scale enterprise AI transformation and an opportunity for AI adoption in the enterprise to accelerate, SaaS to remain a utility, and the market's reaction as overstated.

The development has been framed as positive, emphasizing co-design and open-source collaboration. Ganesh Ramakrishnan is building India's first government-backed foundation model, aimed at sovereign AI capabilities and domain-specific applications. Ramakrishnan stresses the need for public-private partnerships and patient capital to sustain deep-tech AI startups.

Expert opinions suggest that AI will augment, not replace, human work, improving data processing speed and decision-making in sectors like agriculture, disaster management, and aviation. The upcoming India AI Impact Summit is a platform to showcase these initiatives and attract funding, with leaders from governments, industry, and research, including Sundar Pichai, Jensen Huang, and Mukesh Ambani, in attendance.

The funding landscape in India is vibrant, with early-stage AI startups attracting strong VC interest, but late-stage capital is still lagging behind the West. Improvements are rapid, but building talent, proving product-market fit, and delivering returns are essential to unlock larger funding streams. The current stance favors an iterative, light-touch approach to AI, with heavy-handed AI laws being viewed as potentially stifling innovation.

Indian IT majors see AI as an "infrastructure-to-intelligence" journey built on five layers - infra, model, agent-building, application, and experience. The real payoff from AI comes from embedding it into customers' business context, curating and fine-tuning domain-specific data, and delivering end-to-end use cases that improve productivity. TCS has packaged its AI work into the Pro Intelligence suite, comprising industry platforms, a delivery platform, and a development platform.

AI is expected to compress some traditional maintenance revenue via productivity-boosting agents, but the net effect is expected to be strong growth, driven by new AI-factory services, data-center planning, GPU infrastructure, and managed services. Clients are cautiously optimistic, with discretionary AI spend recovering slowly, driven by the need for data modernization and realistic expectations about AI. The country's large talent pool and service footprint position it to lead the "enterprise-grade" AI transformation.

Significant changes are underway in India's IT sector, driven by the increasing adoption of AI-driven automation tools. Global giants are replacing traditional, labor-intensive services with AI-powered solutions, prompting fears of massive layoffs. Approximately 123,000 jobs are expected to be lost in 2025, with further cuts anticipated in 2026. The sector's core business model is at risk, as clients opt for AI-driven tooling over outsourced manpower.

Notably, 60-70% of Indian IT revenue still comes from traditional services that AI targets, highlighting the need for the sector to adapt. Demand for senior-level talent has risen sharply, particularly for system architects, security and privacy experts, AI and ML engineers, and prompt engineers. Salaries for these roles have increased by 30-40% due to scarcity and higher value creation.

Experts suggest that the shift towards AI engineers and higher-value roles started a year ago, wiping out entry-level jobs while creating new, higher-skill opportunities. The education and skilling ecosystem is scrambling to keep up with the disruption, which is unfolding faster than past tech revolutions. To adapt, students must focus on domain-heavy skills and combine technical knowledge with industry expertise. Mid-level engineers who can design, validate, and manage AI-augmented workflows remain in demand.

India's IT sector is reorienting its hiring priorities towards experienced talent capable of AI-augmented design and domain integration. Mid-level and specialist salaries are rising due to scarcity and higher value creation. Business models are being adapted, with companies shifting from billable-hours to outcome-based pricing, incorporating AI-driven productivity metrics. Reskilling and upskilling are becoming essential, with organizations funding upskilling initiatives, but individuals must also treat continuous learning as a personal budget item.

Karnataka has emerged as a leader in industrial and technology growth, positioning itself as India's premier innovation hub. The state showcased its industrial strengths at the World Economic Forum 2026, highlighting a broad ecosystem that spans manufacturing, renewable energy, data centers, aerospace, defense, robotics, AI, and semiconductors. Karnataka has attracted high-level meetings with global firms, commitments of over 50% of pledged funds, and concrete examples of industrial growth. Infrastructure upgrades are being implemented to de-congest Bangalore, with policy levers to attract Global Capability Centres and future-focus parks in pharma, deep-tech, and net-zero.

The Indian government prioritizes energy security for its citizens, with diversified sourcing being a key focus area. The recently signed US-India trade deal aims to boost exports, particularly in labor-intensive sectors, by lowering tariffs on "Made in India" goods.

India's economic indicators show a mixed performance. The Sensex and Nifty indices broke a three-day rally, with blue-chip losses outpacing broader indices. PSU banks were an exception, edging up by approximately 0.3%. Sectoral losers included Hindalco, Eterna, and HAL, while Trent, Max Health, and Tartar Steel recorded gains.

Commodity markets experienced significant declines, with silver plummeting 13% and Bitcoin hitting a 14-month low around $71,000. The crypto market cap has dropped to about half its 2025 peak.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to maintain interest rates at the next meeting, with 90% of respondents believing so and 30% anticipating a 25 basis points cut later this year. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal indicated that the first tranche of the India-US trade deal could be signed by mid-March, with a joint statement and executive order to cut tariffs.

Fiscal federalism remains a contentious issue, with the 16th Finance Commission highlighting a clash between states and the central government over tax devolution. States seek a higher share, up to 50%, and inclusion of central surplus and surcharges in the divisible pool, while the centre maintains the current 41% share is unsustainable.

In international relations, a phone call between US President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping covered various issues, including Taiwan, Iran, Russia, and Ukraine. India's cricket team is set to participate in the ICC T20 World Cup, but its match against Pakistan has been shrouded in controversy.

Notably, Indian FMCG firms are accelerating their push into health-focused nutrition through acquisitions. Marico acquired a 60% stake in digital-first functional wellness brand Cosmix, valuing it at around ₹375 crore. This move is part of a broader trend of major Indian players scaling health-focused consumer brands.

**Key Points from the Interview with DK Sunil, CMD of HAL**

The status of the LCA Mark-1A aircraft is being monitored closely by HAL, with 5 aircraft fully ready for delivery, and 9 additional airframes having been built and flight-tested, bringing the total ready fleet to 14. HAL expects to have 24 aircraft ready by year-end once the remaining engines arrive. The company has received 5 GE F404 engines, with GE committing to deliver 24 engines in calendar year 2026, a schedule that HAL believes it can accommodate.

The primary cause of the LCA delivery lag was the shortage of engines, which is now being addressed. With the upcoming engine deliveries, HAL expects to catch up and meet its contractual deadlines for the 180-aircraft order, targeted for 2032-33. The company has not received any official communication that it is out of the AMCA race and remains optimistic about its prospects.

HAL's order book includes 156 Prachand attack helicopters, 180 LCA units, and other projects, with the company projecting FY 22-23 revenue growth of 8-10%. Despite engine-delivery headwinds, HAL maintains its guidance, relying on diversified product streams. The company sees its indigenous design-development capabilities as unmatched in India and views its ecosystem partners more as collaborators than competitors.

The company disagrees with the RFI clause that penalizes firms with large order books, arguing that scale is essential for global competitiveness and export ambitions. HAL is focused on securing firm delivery commitments from GE rather than developing an alternative engine solution, as the company cannot substitute the F404 engine once the airframe is built.

**Key Points from the Interview with Omer Abush, CEO, Pearson**

Pearson believes that recent AI plugin releases have caused a $285 billion sell-off in software stocks due to investor uncertainty about AI's impact across sectors. The key lesson is that AI will dramatically shorten the half-life of skills, making continuous learning essential. The company's focus is on teaching people how to learn, with a key emphasis on preparing legacy IT firms in India for the changing landscape.

Indian companies must lean into innovation, upskill staff on AI tools, and maintain investor confidence by demonstrating AI-enabled productivity and new revenue streams. The global skill gap is significant, with no country being AI-ready today. Pearson sees a worldwide shortage in teachers equipped to train the next-generation workforce, with the biggest deficiency being in vocational and learning-to-learn capabilities.

Pearson's 2026 priorities include company-wide AI fluency, customer-centric product evolution, and scaling sales, marketing, and localization. The company believes that companies cannot accurately map existing or future skill inventories, leading to signalling failure, and that training teachers to use AI in classrooms is a key solution.

CNBC TV18 reports details of an interview highlighting the importance of systematic investment plans (SIPs) in building wealth over the long term. The guest, Bala, emphasizes the key role of disciplined, continuous investing, citing rupee-cost averaging and compounding as essential factors in smooth price fluctuations. Bala warns against stopping SIPs during market downturns and attempting to time the market, advocating instead for regular contributions. Systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs), which allow investors to draw a modest, regular income while maintaining the remaining assets invested, are also discussed. 

A flagship fund with a 20-year track record is cited as an example of successful SIP implementation, achieving a 19% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). According to this example, a ₹10,000 monthly SIP invested over 25 years would grow to approximately ₹5 crore, from which a SWP of ₹90,000 per month could be sustained for decades while preserving the bulk of the corpus.

The World Economic Forum 2026 Summary focuses on the Telangana Rising 2047 initiative, a comprehensive vision aimed at transforming Telangana into a top global AI hub and a leading destination for life sciences, green energy, and advanced manufacturing. The "CURE-PURE-RARE" framework is presented as a strategic model for the state's development, which includes low-density urban services zones, manufacturing zones, and agrarian-rural zones.

Details of various key initiatives under the Telangana Rising 2047 initiative are provided, including the establishment of the Telangana AI Innovation Hub (TAIH) and the Telangana AI Innovation App (ICOM), in addition to the Telangana Life Sciences Policy and data centre push. Furthermore, the rural pilot, which involves a full-fiber rollout to 85% of villages, and an AI-enabled learning demonstration at a remote school are mentioned.

Approximately ₹23,000 crore in investment MOUs and commitments have been secured, with specific details provided for steel, beauty-tech, aeronautical, and nuclear projects. Partnerships with various global entities are also announced, including Georgetown University, Pearson, and Tata Group.

The policy launches at Davos include the Global Life-Sciences Policy, the AI Innovation Hub announcement, and a ₹1,000 crore startup fund to bridge mid-stage financing gaps for Telangana-based companies.

The Global Lens - AI Impact Summit 2026 is taking place in India from February 16 to 20, aiming to position the country as a catalyst for inclusive and responsible AI. It is the first summit of its kind in the Global South, expecting over 100 countries and 15-20 heads of government to participate. The event is expected to bring together 50+ ministers, 40+ CEOs, and other stakeholders to discuss the potential of AI in India and the Global South.

Prof. PJ Narayanan emphasizes India's strong technology talent, know-how, data, and willingness, making it a powerful yet responsible AI player. Prof. Sandeep Pandandapat highlights India's opportunity to bridge the gap between advanced economies and the Global South by developing cost-efficient and scalable AI models. These models will be particularly beneficial in low-resource contexts where other countries may struggle to deploy AI effectively.

The summit is also expected to address governance and ethical considerations of AI. Prof. Narayanan notes that rapid advancements in AI demand robust governance of tools and data to prevent misuse and unintended harms. This will involve shaping frameworks that balance AI's benefits with necessary safeguards.

Prof. Pandandapat stresses the importance of building AI-aware talent alongside model development, focusing on data collection, particularly in multilingual and mobile-first contexts. Indian IT firms face a challenge with the launch of AI tools like Claude by Anthropic, which threatens the core of the country's $283 billion outsourcing sector. This shift could erode long-term contract renewals and compress margins, forcing Indian IT players to accelerate AI-related revenue streams to sustain growth.

Meanwhile, Transport Corporation of India (TCI) has reaffirmed its FY guidance, citing a strong Q4 outlook. The company's freight segment is increasing, with a target of 40% LTL mix by FY27. Volumes are expected to continue picking up, and guidance remains achievable.

Market activity was subdued, with the Nifty closing lower and a three-day losing streak. The Nifty Bank and Small-Cap indices declined, while the Mid-Cap index remained flat. Public Sector Units (PSU) banks were the sole large-cap sector to record gains. Sectoral leaders included Trent, Max Health, and Tata Steel, while losses were incurred by Hindalco, Eternal, Bharat Electronics, and BEL.

Significantly, Godrej Properties reported strong Q3 results, with bookings rising 55% year-on-year, collections increasing by 40%, and operating cash flow rising 73%. This performance positioned the company to exceed its FY-26 booking guidance of ₹32,500 crore, with nine-month bookings already reaching ₹24,008 crore. However, despite this upbeat guidance, the stock remains depressed, with market participants remaining cautious due to demand risks, particularly concerning the company's exposure to the weaker NCR market.

The Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation has proposed a 5% fare increase, which is pending further consideration. The final decision rests with the metro's central authority. The proposed increase has been met with opposition from the BJP, who have accused the Congress of burdening commuters.

The India-US trade deal, announced in conjunction with the Union Budget, was seen as a move to restore the status quo. The deal involves reciprocal tariffs of around 18%, with India committing to import more US energy and reduce Russian crude purchases. The deal's content is somewhat vague, with its impact on growth expected to be modest.

The Union Budget highlights long-term resilience over headline-grabbing measures. It includes a hike in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on Futures and Options (F&O) to curb exuberance in derivatives trading. The Budget also offers a 21-year tax holiday for foreign firms utilizing Indian data centers to serve global cloud customers and a 15% tax concession for Global Capability Centers.

Domestic flows are expected to sustain markets, but persistent underperformance of Indian equities and heavy FPI outflows have been noted. The US trade deal may help stabilize sentiment but is unlikely to reverse structural trends. India's growth impulse is expected to come more from internal reforms, such as PLI schemes, infrastructure, and renewable power, than from the US trade pact.

A recent update on PB Fintech has led to the postponement of its board meeting to finalize fundraising and a planned acquisition following a 15% drop in stock and shareholder opposition. The company is likely to reassess its plans before moving forward.

Meanwhile, HAL's Chairman and Managing Director clarified that there is no official confirmation that the company has been excluded from the AMCA prototype competition. The AMCA RFI involves a significant ₹15,000 crore contract and production is scheduled for around 2035. HAL emphasizes its design capabilities, experience, and R&D and product portfolio, including indigenous fighters and helicopters, and expects to compete for the production contract even if it misses the prototype phase.

Concerns about dilution have driven the stock's sharp recovery despite strong Q3 results. HAL views potential competition as a natural move toward a more robust defense-aviation sector, citing increasing private-sector participation. The company plans to grow its civil-aviation share from 5% to 25% of its total business within ten years.

John David Lovelock of Gartner states that Anthropic's new AI plugins will not alter Gartner's outlook on AI spending. AI will boost overall productivity but also force workforce rebalancing and pricing pressures. Hardware pricing is expected to increase for AI-ready chips, software costs will be driven by AI features, and consulting services will face cost reductions.

Storm Leonardo caused severe flooding in southern Spain, prompting an emergency response. CNBC TV 18 launched its new "India Business Hour" show, which covers market, macro, and policy news.

Kunal Shah of Nimble Bank Securities notes that extreme volatility in silver markets makes it unsuitable for trading or short-term buying. He predicts near-term price pressure toward $65 per ounce and advises selling on any rises and staying away from silver due to high margin requirements, weak industrial demand, and limited supply-driven price support.

Dr. Adil Agarwal highlighted a strong Q3, with revenue up ~22-23% and EBITDA margins around 27-28%. The company plans to expand its centers, focusing on Delhi/NCR, and aims to add 50-60 new centers annually, funded mainly by internal accruals and modest debt.

HAL plans to await formal decisions from DRDO and the government before taking any action, while remaining confident in its capabilities and future growth.

Institutional investors are shifting their focus from large-cap to small- and mid-cap stocks, which is contributing to a modest positive flow in the market. Commodities, however, remain under pressure due to global cues.

Notable stocks are experiencing buying interest, including JSPL, which is gaining due to metal-sector buying and a leading domestic mutual fund accumulating shares. Crompton Consumer is recovering after its earnings were released, while institutional interest is returning. INX Change is benefiting from a small-cap rally driven by a leading Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) accumulating shares. Radico Ketch is stabilizing after a correction, with rumors of a senior-level hire and possible corporate development.

Aboard meeting cancellation and planned overseas acquisition of PV FinTech has led to a modest rally, with shares up around 10%. However, concerns remain about the impact of the aborted acquisition on long-term investor sentiment. Short-covering contributed to the rally, but concerns persist about the future of PV FinTech.

QSR stocks are expected to be driven by three key factors this quarter: same-store sales (SSG), margins, and valuations. Recent GST-related cost declines have lifted gross margins, while delivery growth can still contribute to revenue. However, dine-in remains weak, limiting total SS growth. QSR valuations have risen 30-40% over the past six-nine months, despite structural growth concerns.

The Devyani-Sapphire merger is expected to improve gross margin by 60-70 basis points through cost synergies. However, valuation gaps may narrow as Sapphire trades at a discount. Pizza Hut's turnaround has been noted, but its store-addition outlook is modest. Jubilant FoodWorks remains the only QSR likely to grow its store count by 8-10% annually.

Trent's gains are driven by Westside's strong store-count expansion and higher margins compared to Zudio. However, Zudio's scalability poses a risk to Trent's growth and margins. If Westside's momentum fades, Trent could face headwinds.

Interarch Building Solutions is projecting a strong revenue growth of around 30% YoY in FY26, followed by a 15% increase in FY27 and a further 20% rise in FY28, exceeding the target set at its IPO. The company has already delivered 40% above its original guidance for the current year, posting Q3 sales of around ₹522 crore and a net order book of ₹1,650-1,685 crore. Capacity is being expanded, with additional steel-building capacity expected to support anticipated order-book growth. Margins are approaching double-digit levels, but remain slightly below.

The QSR stocks, specifically Westlife, Devyani International, and Sapphire, are broadly expected to continue their upward trend according to various brokerages. Westlife, a McDonald's franchise, has been retained as an overweight stock by JPMorgan and Macquarie following its Q3 EBITDA beat, attributed to lower royalty payouts and normalized third-party delivery. Westlife is anticipated to maintain its sales momentum, a crucial factor in the sector's forward trajectory.

The merger between Devyani International and Sapphire is seen as a long-term catalyst, with Macquarie maintaining an overweight stance and Jefferies upgrading the stock to "Buy." Devyani International posted positive same-store sales growth in January, achieved breakeven EBITDA for its new "Biryani by the Kilo" brand, and announced a CEO transition. Bernstein highlighted the leadership change as the start of a recovery path.

In the realm of finance, stagnant home-loan tax benefits are deemed outdated in light of rising house prices and larger loans. Updating these incentives to reflect current market realities is expected to unlock significant demand from first-time buyers. Conversely, the price of gold and silver has experienced a correction following a parabolic rally driven by speculative buying and central-bank demand.

Gold and silver are anticipated to stay negative in the immediate outlook, although the speakers remain long-term bullish on precious metals. Investors are advised to manage their positioning strategically, shift exposure from silver to gold, and lock in profits on existing ETF positions. 

Welspun Enterprises has adjusted its FY-26 revenue guidance downward from ₹4,000 crore to ₹3,600-3,700 crore due to an extended monsoon, delayed major project award, and statutory clearances. Despite this, the firm expects to meet or exceed its EBITDA target. The company remains fundamentally strong on profitability and order-book, aiming to close FY-26 with a consolidated order book of about ₹20,000 crore.

Century Plyboards has announced Q3FY26 results, with revenue growth of 18.4% and a 100-basis-point margin improvement year-on-year. The company expects to meet its FY26 revenue guidance, with overall growth anticipated at 18-20%. Segment-wise growth is expected to be 15% in plywood, 10% in laminate, 20% in MDF, and 80% in particle board.

The demand environment has been described as "challenging", with delayed inventory from post-COVID launches temporarily dampening demand. However, new product launches are expected to drive robust growth in the coming years. Timber and resin prices have stabilised after peaking, supporting margin stability.

Ramesh Damani, a prominent investor, has shared his views on the Indian investment landscape. He notes that the traditional IT model has been "derated", as cash-rich dividend-paying services firms have been replaced by AI-driven product companies. These companies are valued at multiples that dwarf the entire Indian IT sector, signalling a move from licensing/IP to commoditised software.

Damani also highlights the shift toward critical minerals and defense, with future value creation centring on control and processing of strategic minerals essential for defense, renewable energy, and advanced manufacturing. He suggests that nations are building self-sufficient defense supply chains, and India must develop its own mining, refining, and manufacturing capabilities to capture this upside.

Regarding trade and geopolitics, Damani notes that recent US-India trade talks provide relief but are fragile, with U.S. policy remaining unpredictable. India is likely to stay in the U.S. camp on key security issues, yet must balance non-alignment and relations with Russia/Europe. Protectionist trends are pushing all countries toward self-reliance, especially in defense and critical minerals.

In the IT sector, Anthropic's new AI tools have raised fears of "disintermediation", potentially replacing layers of enterprise software from firms like ServiceNow, Salesforce, and SAP. This could threaten Indian IT firms that earn 40-70% of revenue from implementing, developing, and maintaining those packages. However, some analysts believe that Indian IT has already priced in bad news and can benefit from the long-haul "readiness" work that will fuel demand for services.

Alphabet has announced a 2026 cap-ex plan of about $185 billion, signalling confidence that AI is not a bubble. Industry leaders such as BlackRock's Larry Fink and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani urge aggressive AI investment to avoid ceding advantage to China.

IKS Health has reported a strong Q3, characterized by a 24% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and an increase in EBITDA margins to approximately 34%, up from 29% in the previous year. The company's revenue breakdown shows that about 49% of its revenue comes from its top 10 clients. Management aims to outpace the 12% long-term outsourcing market growth, expecting a sustainable expansion over a 5-15-year horizon.

IKS Health has been leveraging Anthropic's Claude AI for code generation, which has more than halved engineering cycle times and decoupled head-count growth from revenue growth, driving margin expansion. Management views generative-AI tools as a tailwind rather than a threat and expects continued margin improvement as they expand R&D and sales/marketing spend.

In contrast, Tata Power's Q3 results were impacted by a base-year run-off and the shutdown of the Mundra plant. The company's MD & CEO, Ravi Sinha, mentioned that all 12 issues with Gujarat's PPA are settled, with only the post-2038 supply clause under discussion. He expects a final agreement and Mundra's restart within the month.

Tata Power's Q4 projections include a 7-8% demand rise as temperatures climb, with revenue and EBITDA expected to improve substantially over Q3 and the same quarter last year. Sinha is confident that the review of distribution-company finances will unlock PPP opportunities in Uttar Pradesh and other stressed states.

Wonder Products Group, a New Delhi-based contract manufacturer, is exploring the sale of a 30-35% stake for roughly $250 million. The company's founder, Bhalotia family, has hired PwC as an advisor to professionalize the business ahead of a future public listing.

The contract manufacturing industry has seen heightened investor interest, driven by direct-to-consumer (DTC) growth, increased outsourcing by Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) firms, and premium-product demand. Wonder Products Group's management believes the company is on track to meet its FY target of ₹5,000 crore revenue and a 13% EBITDA margin.

The company is expected to benefit from an up-cycle in the steel market, with demand and price realization anticipated to strengthen from January. Management is focusing on CAPEX aimed at backward integration, operational efficiency, and capacity utilization over the next 12-24 months.

Imami has reported solid Q3 results, with 9% volume growth driven by a strong winter portfolio. Revenue rose ~10%, margins edged up to 33.4%, and net profit increased ~15%. Management highlighted expected seasonal loading in Feb-Mar, early signs of rural demand recovery, and easing raw-material costs. Bangladesh demand remained robust, with double-digit consumer growth anticipated.

It is reported that Tata Power's Q3 earnings have been affected by large losses at the Mundra thermal plant and delays in the commissioning of renewable-energy sources. The company incurred a ₹3 billion quarterly loss at the Mundra plant, contributing to an almost ₹8 billion loss over the first nine months. Despite this, the Orissa discount segment drove a 2.6-times profit jump, while the solar manufacturing profits were flat quarter-over-quarter. Renewable energy grew 2.6-times, led by the solar cell and module plant, although overall margins slipped. Analysts have downgraded the outlook, with Morgan Stanley assigning an equal-weight rating and JPMorgan maintaining a neutral stance.

Indian companies in the food industry have reported mixed results. Westlife Food's Q3 EBITDA beat expectations, driven by lower royalty payouts, while Devyani International's January same-store sales growth despite a weak December has been met with both positive and cautious views from analysts. Devyani's dine-in value options, delivery normalization, and upcoming merger with Sapphire have been highlighted as potential positives, but there is concern that the January rebound may not be sustainable.

Trent's Q3 earnings showed a 36% profit jump despite a slowdown in revenue growth, with gross margin expanding for the first time in five quarters. The company attributed the profit surge to a 201% rise in other income, and management expects a gradual recovery in consumer sentiment. Brokerage reactions to the results are mixed, with Bernstein maintaining an outperform rating while others trimmed their targets.

Research analysts have also provided insights into the Indian IT services sector. Girish Pai from BOB Capital notes that Indian IT services valuations are currently around their 10-year average, and that uncertainty around "agentic AI" is pressuring investors' EPS expectations. He anticipates a possible 10-15% price correction, which could present entry points if earnings hold.

In the meantime, Cognizant has reported a FY-26 revenue growth of 4-6.5%, beating expectations and resulting in a 3% rise in shares. The broader IT sector has seen a decline in Indian IT stocks, with the Nifty IT index falling 6.5%. Analysts have warned that AI agents could potentially erode 40-70% of Indian IT firms' application-services revenue, implying a potential downside to IT valuations.

Recent AI releases from Anthropic and Palantir are expected to have a significant impact on the Indian IT services industry. The introduction of AI technology is anticipated to compress labor-intensive work, potentially threatening traditional time-and-material and staff-augmentation revenue models of large Indian IT firms. However, this threat is partly overstated, as most Indian IT projects involve complex, structured-data transformations that AI tools are not yet able to fully replace.

In the short term, the impact of AI on Indian IT services is limited, as enterprises with complex, multi-country operations still require extensive consulting and integration services. Nevertheless, the medium-to-long-term impact is expected to be significant, as AI can automate many tasks, reduce headcount requirements, and erode margin-heavy, low-value-add models.

According to experts, Indian IT players must upskill their talent, especially mid-senior staff, adopt AI-centric delivery, and secure "street permission" to invest in a multi-year reinvention. Larger firms face legacy inertia, but mid-size, more agile firms are likely to adapt faster, while younger hires already comfortable with AI tools reduce the entry-level training burden.

Meanwhile, Nomura retains a Buy call on Cummins India, citing strong domestic demand and a solid balance sheet. However, UPS and GM Financial maintain Sell calls, citing revenue misses and poor export growth. Market indices are down, with the Nifty around 25,690-25,725 and the Sensex down 0.2%.

In other news, Gregory Meeks accuses the OCC of allowing a UAE-linked firm to acquire a significant stake in Trump's crypto company, World Liberty Financial, while the president conducts foreign policy with the UAE. He demands a pause and scrutiny of any bank charter or licensing application tied to the company until congressional review.

Waist-deep floods struck Alcácer do Sal in Portugal after storms named Kristin and Leo, causing widespread damage.

Stock markets are expected to trade with a mixed performance, with Gift Nifty opening lower. A potentially high-valuation IT firm rose approximately 5% due to earnings expectations, showing revenue growth and margin improvement, but remains over-valued in the long term due to its high forward price-to-earnings ratio. The Indian IT sector is expected to experience modest top-line growth, limited by currency depreciation and lack of innovative product launches.

Orient Pro has been identified as an attractive IT stock due to its recent revenue and EBITDA growth, margin expansion, and FY-26 guidance of approximately 30% growth, as well as a strong order book in data-center and banking segments. The company's forward valuation is considered reasonable.

Defense stock HAL saw a downgrade after losing a major contract, but its solid order backlog and valuation suggest it is a viable long-term investment. Market sentiment has shifted due to the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, which may not materialize immediately. Despite muted growth, Indian IT stocks are believed to be undervalued by comparison to their U.S. counterparts, given their lower multiples, dividend payments, and lower capital expenditure.

The market direction is contingent upon whether AI adoption accelerates in the second half of the year and broader macroeconomic risks, including rising capital expenditure, inflation, and geopolitical volatility, which may affect commodity prices and corporate margins.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has launched an investigation into IndiGo over allegations of market dominance following a significant increase in ticket prices. The CCI rejected IndiGo's claim that the matter falls under the jurisdiction of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and will examine the reasons for flight cancellations in December and potential abuse of dominance.

US equity markets experienced a decline, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down, while the dollar index edged up. In contrast, gold and silver prices rebounded, with gold increasing by 0.5% and silver rising by 6%. Oil prices also surged to $69 per barrel.

The Indian market witnessed a slight increase, driven by gains in Reliance, banks, and mid-to-small-cap stocks. However, IT stocks dropped by 6%. The market is testing a crucial gap zone, with key resistance levels identified around 25,600-25,900.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have been active in the market, adding to their long positions and covering short contracts. Put-writing activity suggests support around 25,600-25,650, while resistance is near 25,800-25,900. Commodities remain volatile, with the stalled US-Iran nuclear talks a major concern.

Globally, AI-linked stocks have shown mixed reactions. Alphabet, Apple, and Palantir posted varied results, with the consensus pointing to caution due to AI hype pricing potential upside. The outlook for Indian IT is mixed, with various brokerages predicting a range of impacts from the rise of generative-AI tools.

Bank of America (BofA) anticipates AI will boost certain services but pressure software-services revenues. Jefferies predicts a significant revenue hit to application-services lines, while Morgan Stanley expects a neutral impact. Macquarie views AI-related disruption as overstated, and Citi highlights continued strength in the Global Capability Center (GCC) segment.

Brokerages warn that AI will present productivity gains, but also poses potential revenue pressure on traditional services, with varying severity across company size and service lines. The rise of generative-AI tools has sparked concerns about the impact on Indian IT stocks, with a mixed outlook emerging.

Asian markets, including Taiwan, Korea, Shanghai, and Japan, experienced lower opening prices, mirroring the sell-off on Wall Street. The Nifty in India indicated a flat start due to the Sensex weekly expiry. The Nifty's near-term upside targets are 25,800 and 26,000.

Major results are expected from various companies, including Barathi Hotels, Hero Motorcorp, IOC, CANFIN, PFC, LIC, and NSDL. Yesterday's Nifty gain, despite a 6% fall in the IT-index, was primarily driven by gains in Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank. These companies will be closely monitored for sustained support.

Tata Power reported lower-than-expected profits, but its EBITDA was above estimates. Metropolis Health posted a 32% increase in profits and a 26% rise in revenue, triggering a 3:1 bonus issue. Other companies, such as JSW Cement, missed revenue and EBITDA targets, while Medanta saw a 19% increase in revenue, but declining margins.

FIIs remain net buyers, covering short positions and purchasing index futures worth approximately Rs 1,800 crore. Options flow suggests active put trades at 25,700 and 25,800, indicating immediate support at 25,600-25,650. A decisive move above 25,850-26,000 is necessary for sustained upside.

India's top listed EMS firms, Syrma SGS and Dixon Technologies, are re-evaluating their semiconductor-manufacturing plans in response to the new ISM 2.0 program. This program aims to establish a full-stack semiconductor ecosystem and could lead to vertical integration and long-term value creation for EMS companies.

Tata Motors' acquisition of Iveco's truck, bus, and power-train business is being scrutinized, particularly in light of Iveco's reduced cash-flow outlook. However, analysts remain optimistic about potential synergies, cross-selling opportunities, and cost reductions from shared engineering platforms and supply-chain rationalization. The combined entity is expected to generate significant revenue and free cash flow.

Financial news highlights various key developments in the market. Cognizant, a leading technology company, has reported strong fourth-quarter earnings, posting $5.3 billion in revenue and $21.1 billion for the full year. The company's bookings rose by 9%, and management highlighted the success of its $1 billion AI-and-cloud pivot, which is driving new growth and expanding the total addressable market.

In contrast, the Competition Commission of India has ordered a 90-day antitrust investigation into IndiGo, alleging abuse of its dominant position. IndiGo holds around 60% of domestic passenger volumes and capacity, and the investigation will be conducted by the CCI's Director General. The probe stems from IndiGo's cancellations of over 4,500 flights in early December and subsequent sharp fare increases for stranded passengers.

Meanwhile, QuestCorp, a staffing solutions arm of a de-merged company, has reported solid post-de-merger fundamentals. The company's revenue grew by 3% quarter-over-quarter, and its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) improved by 104% on a quarterly basis. QuestCorp uses AI-driven talent-matching and payroll/compliance platforms, and its international business is expanding, particularly in the Middle East.

However, the company's return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE) remain sub-double-digit, and investors are awaiting the promised improvements in these areas. The company's stock price has declined by around 27% over the past six months, but its valuation remains cheaper than that of its peers. QuestCorp's management has promised double-digit growth in headcount and revenue, as well as high-teens EBITDA margin.

Industry analysts remain positive on QuestCorp, with seven buy recommendations and one hold, and an estimated 12-month upside of around 43%. However, the company's return improvements and Q4 catch-up after the labour-code pause are crucial for unlocking its upside potential. The stock's performance may be influenced by the GCC-driven growth wave and the company's success in delivering double-digit ROE/ROCE. The company's use of AI for talent-city matching, payroll compliance, and workforce query handling is expected to automate low-skill tasks and push demand toward higher-value roles.

A Senate hearing was conducted on the pending Warner Bros.-Discovery merger, during which Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was questioned by Senator Josh Hawley about the merger's impact on U.S. employees and production jobs. Sarandos stated that production would grow and that Netflix already utilizes union labor on U.S. shoots, with no intention of changing this practice. He also pledged to maintain a 45-day theatrical window for major Warner Bros. films.

The discussion then shifted to the matter of worker benefits, with Hawley demanding a firm commitment to "full residuals" for Netflix workers. Sarandos provided a non-committal response, citing the complexity of the issue and upcoming negotiations with unions. Hawley also raised concerns about Netflix's children's programming, accusing the platform of promoting "transgender ideology" and featuring "highly sexualized" content. Sarandos responded that Netflix has no political agenda and provides parental controls to block any titles.

Concerns were raised by other senators about the potential reduction of creative diversity resulting from the merger, to which Sarandos reassured them that Netflix will maintain independent buying teams and continue to produce content to expand opportunities for creators.

Bill Gates addressed allegations surrounding a purported "never-sent" email from Jeffrey Epstein, denying the claim and expressing regret for having met Epstein. The authenticity of the email claim has been disputed.

The IT sector experienced a decline due to the launch of new AI plug-ins by Anthropic, sparking fears of "disintermediation" for Indian IT firms. This was reflected in the stock performance of major IT companies, such as Infosys and TCS.

India's first pure-play AI IPO, Fractal Analytics, is set to debut next week with a trimmed issue size. Hindustan Aeronautics reported a potential setback in the AMCA stealth-fighter project, resulting in a share dip.

Market experts have issued warnings about the continued impact of AI-related pricing pressure on IT earnings, while predicting a short-term upside to around 26,000 for the Nifty index.

Market reactions to recent developments in the tech and startup sectors are being closely monitored by analysts and investors. The introduction of Anthropic's AI-powered plugins for its Claude co-work agent has triggered a sharp sell-off in Indian IT stocks, with the IT index declining by 6.5% and major firms experiencing falls of 7% or more. Global service firms, such as Accenture and Cognizant, are also experiencing similar drops, prompting fears that AI could replace large parts of the labor-intensive outsourcing model that drives 60-70% of India's IT revenue.

Industry experts are debating the impact of AI on the IT sector, with some arguing that it is an over-reaction while others see it as a genuine inflection point. Panelists, including Sandeep Agarwal, Jameela Saiba, Dhruv Salwadi, and Raja Lahiri, agree that AI will compress low-value, repetitive work, forcing Indian IT firms to pivot toward AI-first platforms, proprietary models, vertical solutions, and extensive reskilling.

Meanwhile, the Indian government's budget has been met with mixed reactions. Although the budget's core message of prioritizing reform, action, and people over populism remains unchanged, market disappointment is evident. However, analysts like Nilesh Shah argue that the structural reforms, such as the increased Securities Transaction Tax (STT), are positive signals for long-term growth.

In the startup space, Base Care, a Bengaluru-based precision oncology startup, has raised ₹90 crore in the first close of its Series B, led by Ashish Kacholia and Lushit Sangvi. The funds will be used to scale the hospital-embedded lab network, strengthen clinical genomics data and AI stack, and accelerate global expansion. The company aims to close the data diversity gap in cancer care by expanding its AI-powered platform and hospital-linked genomics labs across India and internationally.

The enterprise-first model being adopted by Anthropic, a company founded by ex-OpenAI researchers, is gaining visibility and reshaping the AI investment narrative. This approach prioritizes alignment, safety, and enterprise control over consumer hype, securing multibillion-dollar backing from investors, including Amazon.

India's startup boom is gaining momentum, with major players such as Mobikwik and Reliance leading the way. Mobikwik has recently reported a significant turnaround, reversing a net loss of ₹55 crore in Q3 FY26 to post a profit of ₹4 crore. This improvement is attributed to various factors, including the revival of financial services, with a record ₹900 crore in personal loans disbursed with NDFC partners, and the growth in payments, with a 7% QoQ and 14% YoY increase in revenue.

The company's user base has reached 186.6 million, while the merchant network has grown to 4.79 million. Payments growth is expected to continue, with a focus on scaling UPI and wallet services, which are currently loss-making but expected to break even by the end of FY27. Additionally, Mobikwik aims to expand its lending portfolio while maintaining portfolio quality.

The company's outlook for FY27 also involves a shift towards sustainable growth, rather than prioritizing growth at any cost. This approach is expected to help maintain profitability across all segments. Meanwhile, the Indian IT sector is bracing for the impact of AI-driven market shock, with some experts warning of potential dis-intermediation and revenue compression.

Analysts note that short-term sell-offs may occur, but longer-term growth opportunities arise as AI boosts productivity. Indian IT firms are advised to focus on contextual business expertise, rather than relying solely on integration and customisation services. The sector is set to witness a major shift, with AI tools like the "claw-back" agentic-AI plug-in expected to automate specialized workflows across various sectors.

The Indian government and economy are also experiencing significant developments, with a pending India-US trade deal expected to safeguard agriculture and dairy exports. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee has begun a three-day meeting, with expectations of at least one rate cut in 2026. The Supreme Court has reprimanded the CBI and Enforcement Directorate for delays in probing Anil Ambani's alleged ₹40,000 crore siphoning.

In another development, Warburg Pincus has emphasized India's potential as a major private-equity market, with the firm investing billions of dollars annually.

Devyani International Ltd, operator of Yum! Brands in India, is undergoing a refocusing of its loss-making Pizza Hut unit under the new CEO Manish Dawar. The plan involves halting net new Pizza Hut openings, closing underperforming outlets, upgrading technology, sharpening marketing, innovating the menu, and aligning online-offline strategies. The effort coincides with Devyani's merger with Sapphire Foods, which is expected to generate ₹210-₹225 cr in annual synergies.

Key leadership changes at Devyani include Anupam Kumar as CFO and Neeraj Tiwari as CTO. In the December 2025-26 quarter, Devyani reported 11.3% YoY revenue growth to ₹1,440.9 cr, operating 2,279 outlets globally. Pizza Hut added nine stores to 639, while KFC added 92 stores to 788. Own-brand concepts more than doubled to 218 stores, with delivery contributing 55-60% of sales.

Vodafone Idea has been granted a five-year ADR extension by the government, providing near-term risk cover. Analysts recommend continuing to hold the stock, with a near-term support level of ₹9.50 and a 12-month target of ₹15.16. Gabriel India has announced new order wins, offsetting Q2 slowdown, and is recommended to be held for the next 6-12 months, with a 12-month target of ₹1,100.

Indian IT giants, including Infosys, TCS, and Wipro, have experienced a sharp sell-off following the launch of a new AI model by Antropic. Analysts suggest the impact is uncertain, and more information is expected before the full effect is clear. Technical analysis indicates a bearish short-term bias, and the index could slide to the 35,900-36,000 range in the near term. It is recommended to avoid new positions for now and consider accumulating stocks gradually for the longer term.

State Bank of India is recommended to be bought on dips below ₹1,000, with a short-term upside target of ₹11.20-₹11.50. Bank of Baroda is recommended to be bought on dips below ₹146, with a near-term target of ₹180-₹200. For Chambal Fertilizers, a buy is recommended, with a stop-loss below ₹400, as the stock is expected to break out above ₹455, pushing it toward ₹500+.

Management expectations for a company's EBITDA margin remain positive, with a forecasted range of 20-24% and a lean towards the higher end. This outlook is supported by various factors, including an improved product mix, modest pricing, and cost-effectiveness initiatives. Moreover, stable raw-material prices, specifically VAM (vinyl acetate monomer) prices at around $840/ton, are expected to remain benign. However, a weaker rupee could potentially add pressure on VAM prices.

The demand recovery is driven by a robust portfolio and the government's infrastructure push, which is fueling urban construction and renovation. The gap between urban and rural demand is narrowing, with urban demand now comparable to rural volumes. Exports, which were hit by tariffs and trade frictions, are expected to show a resurgence as tariffs are reduced and a potential EU-India FTA comes into effect.

The company's CAPEX strategy for FY 27-28 involves a mix of growth-oriented and maintenance/modernisation projects, including the expansion of high-growth brands and upgrading existing core-business facilities. These efforts are expected to sustain margins and drive growth.

Simultaneously, the Supreme Court reprimanded the CBI and Enforcement Directorate for delaying investigations into alleged irregularities by Anil Dhirubhai Ambani's group companies, with an estimated siphoning of over ₹40,000 crore.

Market experts offer technical views on notable companies. SBI charts indicate a potential trend shift, with analysts recommending buying around the ₹950-₹975 zone. Varun Beverages outperformed despite seasonal challenges but saw its stock slip due to slower Indian growth and pricing headwinds. Lloyd's Metals & More showed strong Q3 fundamentals but requires positive momentum. V2 Retail's fundamentals are under pressure due to sector sentiment.

Meanwhile, the Singapore Airshow has taken place, showcasing aerobatic displays across the Asia-Pacific region. Mukesh Ambani has urged India to fully embrace AI, viewing the technology as essential for large-scale improvements in education, healthcare, and taxation. He envisions the use of AI-driven digital platforms to deliver quality schooling and a nationwide health system.

Larry Fink emphasizes that there is no AI bubble, but rather a risk of under-investment, which could allow China to seize the lead in advancing AI technologies. The widespread adoption of AI across various sectors, including healthcare and finance, is expected to bring significant improvements in productivity and economic growth. AI's transformative impact is seen as essential for addressing challenges faced by aging societies, where labor markets are shrinking and demographics are shifting.

Mukesh Ambani highlights India's unique position in the global AI landscape due to its large tech-accepting population and rapid digital adoption. The country is poised to leverage AI for various purposes, including improved education, healthcare, and taxation systems. Ambani likens AI to the Industrial Revolution, stating that it can help India leap to developed-world levels within a few decades. The Indian government's approach to AI is expected to prioritize broad-based economic growth and shared wealth creation, rather than allowing inequalities to widen.

In India, AI adoption is still in its early stages, with investors requiring education on the technology's enterprise value. Fractal Analytics, an Indian company, has adjusted its IPO valuation downward in anticipation of lower investor demand. Despite the markdown, the firm plans to use the proceeds for research and development, debt repayment, and operational expansion. The company's growth prospects remain strong, with a revenue increase of 20% year-over-year in the first half of FY2025.

Mukesh Ambani's company, Reliance, has partnered with BlackRock to launch a mission called geo-BlackRock, aimed at converting traditional savers in India into investors. The partnership seeks to channel India's massive savings into productive assets, thereby fuelling economic growth. This effort is expected to align with India's growing interest in the global economy and the emergence of new startup entities.

India's startup ecosystem is reportedly experiencing a surge in confidence among young entrepreneurs. Mukesh Ambani credits sustained law-and-order, national reach, and growing global interest for this economic momentum. The BlackRock partnership is seen as a catalyst for long-term stability and broad-based economic growth in the country. 

The partnership between Reliance and BlackRock seeks to address India's unproductive savings culture by offering safe and transparent investment options. This disruption is expected to unlock idle savings as engines of prosperity for both investors and the nation. 

India's historic culture of saving has been largely unproductive, with large sums tied up in gold and silver rather than productive assets. The geo-BlackRock partnership aims to transform these savings into engines of growth through technology-driven distribution. This approach is seen as essential for India's economic momentum and long-term stability.

The Indian economy has been undergoing significant transformation, with sustained double-digit growth, stable leadership under Prime Minister Modi, and ambitious goals, such as a "Viksit Bharat" by 2047. This growth has been driven by massive infrastructure achievements, including record road building, world-leading renewable-energy capacity, and nationwide 5G coverage. Fiscal prudence, policy continuity, and a thriving startup ecosystem have also contributed to the country's growth, attracting global interest and investment.

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, views India as a leading investment opportunity, emphasizing its vast intellectual capital and ability to adopt and scale global technology. He sees the next 20-25 years as the "era of India," urging investors to focus on long-term growth potential, rather than short-term market cycles. Key drivers of India's growth include rapid digital adoption, a large talent pool, and the democratization of technology.

The Indian mutual-fund industry is expected to more than double in five years, driven by sustained macro growth and a shift of money from low-interest savings accounts to higher-yield investment products. Banks must reinvent themselves to adapt to this transformation, but joint ventures with global companies, such as BlackRock, will be key to capitalizing on opportunities.

Adani Aerospace and Defence has signed a joint venture with Italy's Leonardo to manufacture, maintain, and repair military helicopters in India, with plans to deliver the first India-made Leonardo helicopters before 2030. The company is also eyeing emergency procurement contracts and expanding its space-surveillance business, positioning it for growth in the defense sector, which is expected to benefit from significant government funding.

Byju's insolvency administrator has alleged unlawful actions by the company's founder, Byju Raveendran, and his associates, which may have stripped a special rights holder of its entitlement to Aakash Educational Services Ltd. The dispute is centered on the validity of certain amendments and rights issues, which may require intervention by the courts to correct the share register and restore the rights of the affected parties.

India's economic growth is expected to drive investment and opportunities, including in the defense sector, which is being shaped by global partnerships and significant government funding. The Indian economy's growth potential continues to be a subject of interest and investment.

A ban on social-media access for individuals under the age of 16 has been announced in Spain, which involves the use of robust age-verification methods rather than simple checkboxes. The prime minister cited protection against online addiction, abuse, and exposure to explicit content as the motivation for the ban.

Market trends in India have seen the rupee confined to a tight band, with prices ranging from ₹90.25 to ₹90.50 per dollar. Early-morning buying by state-owned banks and negative sentiment surrounding Anthropic's Claude AI have had a dampening effect on the market. The RBI has maintained a neutral stance, neither buying nor selling dollars, which has helped to ease concerns of intervention.

The new AI tool, Cloudwork, released by Anthropic, is causing a significant disruption in the Indian IT sector. This tool enables companies to automate AI workflows, reducing their reliance on Indian IT outsourcers and thereby threatening their core revenue. As a result, several major players in the sector have witnessed a decline in their stock prices, with some plummeting by as much as 7%.

The Indian IT sector is anticipating a challenging period ahead, as investors closely monitor the Q4 results and management commentary on the impact of Anthropic's tool. The sector's fundamentals remain unchanged, but investors are taking a cautious approach due to concerns about long-term contract renewals and the potential squeeze on margins.

Dinshaw Irani, the CEO of Helios MF, attributes the current slump in the IT sector to the AI-driven reset, which is likely to have a long-term impact on the industry. He is upbeat about the broader markets, however, citing strong earnings growth in small-cap stocks and the potential for fiscal and monetary easing to sustain demand.

Market trends have been green despite the weakness in the IT sector, with the Nifty gaining 60 points. Momentum from recent U.S. trade news has been contributing to the performance of mid- and small-cap stocks, which have witnessed a rise of 1.5-1.8%. Analysts expect another 400-point move in the Nifty, although strength in broader markets is seen as the next driver.

The India-U.S. trade deal has been a significant factor in the rally of textile stocks, with several companies seeing a 10-20% rise in their stock prices. Companies with exposure to the U.S. market have led the rally, with those having a 60-70% exposure witnessing a surge in their stock prices.

Market trends and sector analysis reveal that the Nifty traded above 25,750, while the Sensex remained relatively flat. The IT index experienced a decline, whereas the auto, metal, and oil and gas sectors observed gains. The mid-cap index showed a moderate increase of 0.3 percent, primarily driven by optimism surrounding the US-India trade deal.

Several stocks, including Google-exports, Shila Foam, Kitex, and Avanti Feeds, made significant contributions to the mid-cap index growth. In contrast, stocks such as Hindustan Aeronautics and Exide Industries experienced fluctuations in their market value due to various factors. Exide Industries, for instance, received an upgrade to a "Buy" rating from Nomura, citing the company's healthy auto segment and attractive valuation multiples.

Lloyd's Metals reported a substantial surge in EBITDA, exceeding ₹1,800 crore, with margins improving to around 35 percent. The company provided guidance for higher production levels of iron-ore, pellets, and steel in the subsequent fiscal year. Similarly, Perlite (Pidlight) delivered a 10.2 percent increase in revenue, driven by growth in the construction-chemical brands and projects business.

The Indian IT sector is expected to undergo a significant transformation in the next two-to-three years. The industry will need to adapt to a hybrid people-and-agent model, incorporating AI agents to deliver services. This shift is primarily driven by the introduction of AI-powered automation platforms, such as Anthropic's Claude co-work agent, which has the potential to disintermediate traditional IT service providers.

Lloyd's Metals' profit after tax surged by 180 percent to ₹1,090 crore, with quarterly EBITA reaching ₹1,800 crore. The company's guidance for future production levels and estimated FY EBITA underpin its optimistic market performance. The market's enthusiasm for Lloyd's Metals reflects its strong fundamentals and outlook.

Investment and market trends show varying degrees of stability and growth. The World Gold Council views gold as a long-term diversifier and safe-haven asset, supported by ongoing global debt and geopolitical uncertainty. Despite recent market volatility, the Council remains optimistic about gold's future performance. Global gold demand surpassed 5,000 tonnes in 2025, led by investment demand, while India's total demand fell 11 per cent in volume but rose 35 per cent in value.

India's shift from a net gold importer to a net exporter is anticipated due to the U.S.-India trade agreement, which will make Indian gold-jewelry exports more competitive versus China, Hong Kong, and other hubs. Indian exports are expected to grow, especially to the U.S. market, as high-end luxury gold consumption increases globally.

In the construction chemical sector, Pidilite Industries reported a 10.2 per cent revenue growth and a 28 per cent revenue increase year-over-year, with margins at the upper end of the 20-24 per cent band. The company expects continuous growth, driven by product launches, tight cost control, and the performance of its star brands.

Mahindra Lifespace also reported strong Q3 earnings, with year-over-year growth in bookings, volumes, and collections. The company targets ₹4,500-₹5,000 crore in residential pre-sales for FY27, aided by upcoming launches valued at ₹7,000-₹8,000 crore. Mahindra Lifespace focuses on the domestic market, particularly in Mumbai, Pune, and Bangalore, and is poised for growth in a maturing cycle.

A proposed IPO by NSC, a public sector entity, will use an offer-for-sale route, with existing shareholders expected to dilute about 4-5 per cent of the company. A dedicated committee will be formed to steer the listing, and Deloitte has been hired to handle advisory and process matters.

Indian stock exchange indices, Sensex and Nifty, have maintained a relatively flat position, with the IT index experiencing a decline of roughly 6-7% due to the performance of companies such as Infosys, TCS, and Vipro. However, this downturn has been tempered by the supportive performance of auto stocks and a few large-cap names, including Reliance and the Bank Nifty.

Macro cues are shaping market sentiment, with the US-India trade deal having a positive impact on the gems and jewelry sector by reducing tariffs. The RBI's upcoming monetary policy decision is anticipated to influence market dynamics. The Indian rupee has experienced a slight depreciation against the US dollar, due to increased corporate dollar buying and heightened US-Iran tensions.

IndusInd Bank's exposure to the gems and jewelry sector is approximately 3% of its loan book, with no stressed assets and no requirement for additional provisioning. The bank is expected to modestly grow this book in response to increasing demand from clients.

In the bond market, several states have raised a substantial amount of funds through bond issuances, totaling approximately ₹380 billion. Notable upcoming issuances include bond issues from companies such as Poonawalla Fincorp, Veritas Finance, and JSW Steel.

Acme Solar reported a significant increase in other income, primarily driven by higher cash balances from increased power sales. The company has initiated a capacity expansion program, with a 1.5 GW target for FY27, and projects substantial EBITDA growth in the coming years.

City Union Bank has reported a 21% YoY loan growth in its Q3 results, driven primarily by secured lending. The bank expects to maintain this growth rate, with guidance targeting a mid-to-high-teens growth range. Gold-loan book growth is being achieved through the full-conversion of its portfolio to fixed-rates, mitigating the impact of recent repo-rate cuts.

Jio-BlackRock has launched a low-cost digital advisory platform in India, offering personalized investment advice with a low annual fee. The platform targets mass-affluent investors and high-net-worth clients abroad.

Several companies have made notable announcements recently. IndusInd Bank's loan book has around 3% exposure to the gems and jewellery segment, valued at approximately ₹9,500 crore, which has experienced a flat year due to tariff pressures and reduced post-COVID-19 demand from China. Despite this, the bank has not had to provision for any specific assets migrating to the SMA-1 or SMA-2 categories.

Assessments suggest that the broader MSME portfolio of the bank faces muted risk from U.S. tariffs, with recent reductions in U.S. duties and the EU-India trade deal potentially improving conditions for both traditional gems and lab-grown diamonds. The bank, however, is cautious and considers it too early to commit to expanding the gems and jewellery book, with future growth depending on client discussions and industry recovery.

The bank has also diversified its MSME portfolio with multiple buyer bases, limiting tariff-related stress. Senior leadership changes and restructuring are ongoing, with new appointments made as per regulatory requirements, and further appointments may follow.

The bank's capital position is deemed sufficient, with a capital adequacy ratio of 17% and a Tier-1 ratio of 15.8%. Discussions with sovereign investors have occurred, but there are no plans for a capital raise at present.

In the broader market, the Sensex fell by 180 points, while the Nifty was flat. The IT index experienced a 6.2% decline, but gains in the Nifty Bank and energy stocks offset this weakness.

Vipul Mathur, MP and CEO, discussed his company's performance. Low spending and process and payment delays, despite a budget allocation of ₹67,000 crore, hampered expenditure in the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in FY25. Payments are now flowing, and the pipeline for this project is expected to revive in the next 2-3 years.

The company's exposure to JJM is modest, around ₹50-100 crore, and directly with the government. The company expects its FY26 EBITDA to be near ₹1,800 crore and could reach ₹2,500 crore based on the current run-rate. The FY27 target of ₹3,000 crore appears plausible but will depend on 15% year-on-year EBITDA growth and a strong order book in the US and India.

Syntax Industries, which has exposure to the water and construction sector, experienced growth slowdown and now expects revenue of ₹600-₹700 crore this year. A separate listing of the company may be considered in the future.

HAL, a company involved in the fifth-generation stealth fighter project, lost the bid. Although this setback may impact sentiment, the company's order book remains robust, with a value of ₹1.9 lakh crore as of FY25, expected to rise to ₹2.6 lakh crore in FY26. The stock price has declined by around 5-6%.

GEO BlackRock has launched a digital advisory platform at ₹350 per year, with an approximately 0.35% asset under management. Nazara Tech, despite a 24% decline in headline revenue, saw its EBITDA margin increase to 16.8% and acquired companies cost less than $500 million.

A statement by Hyundai Motor India's managing director, Tarun Karak, has indicated that the company's Q4 is shaping up strongly, driven by a solid January rebound, particularly in the compact-SUV segment. The growth has been observed across various segments, including the Aura, Creta, and the new Venue, with a record-high monthly sales of around 12%. This robust growth is expected to continue, with the company projecting an EBITDA margin of 11-14%.

Castrol India has also reported a positive Q4, with revenue up around 6% and an EBITDA margin of 25.5%, exceeding its guided range. The company has achieved an eighth consecutive quarter of volume growth, outpacing the market, and is targeting volume-driven top-line growth of 1.5-2 times the market.

The Indian economy is expected to grow at a rate of 6.9% in the fiscal year 2026 and 7% in 2027, driven by an export boost from the India-US trade deal and anticipated investment pickups. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to pause policy at the upcoming meeting, with no further cuts anticipated, and shift its focus towards improving liquidity transmission rather than easing.

The CPI basket is expected to be revised, potentially leading to a 40-basis point increase in headline CPI to 4.4-4.5% by mid-year. The RBI is expected to maintain the rupee at around ₹1992/$ in the near term, while gradually reducing the forward position.

The India-US trade deal is expected to lead to a significant increase in US imports, from around $45 billion to $100 billion annually, with growth expected in various sectors, including defense, energy, capital goods, high-end tech, electronics, and pharmacy.

The RBI's current easing of policy is viewed as sufficient, and its stance is expected to remain neutral for the foreseeable future.

Elevated demand has propelled Pidilite's top line, achieving a 10% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by sustained 8-10% volume growth over seven quarters. The company has successfully managed to boost its gross margin to a multi-quarter high of 56.5%, primarily due to reduced input costs. Management remains optimistic regarding demand prospects, citing favorable monsoons, upcoming government expenditure, and the GSE 2.0 project, while exercising caution in the face of geopolitical tensions.

In a related development, Welspun Corp's CEO Vipul Mathur highlighted the company's strong recent performance and outlook, attributing the Jal Jeevan Mission fund allocation of ₹67,000 crore to increased real spending, with payments to EPC contractors resuming. The company's forecasted FY-23 EBITDA is approaching ₹1,800 crore and poised to exceed the ₹2,200 crore guidance, potentially reaching ₹2,500 crore. For FY-24, Welspun Corp aims for 15% year-over-year growth, driven by a robust order book in the US and India.

Meanwhile, gold prices have surged 6% in a single day, surpassing $5,050 an ounce, amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. Analysts are predicting further upside for gold, with forecasts ranging from $6,000 to $6,600 per ounce by year-end.

Bajaj Finance's Q3 operational metrics remained robust, yet profit after tax declined by roughly ₹1,671 crore due to one-time provisions for new labor codes and accelerated ECL provisioning. However, the company's net stress-loan pool has hit its lowest level since Q4, with proactive provisioning having improved coverage ratios and reduced loss-given-default (LGD).

Further, the CEO of India AI Mission has announced the upcoming India AI Impact Summit, scheduled to take place from February 16-20. The five-day event is expected to host 15 heads of government, 50-60 ministers, top tech CEOs, and leading researchers, with over 600 sessions covering various AI-related topics. Key expectations from the summit include major announcements, investment deals, and strategic partnerships in the AI sector, with a focus on establishing India as a premier destination for AI talent and innovation.

Recent market developments have been shaped by various factors, primarily influencing the performance of key sectors and individual companies. The NSE Nifty initially declined by approximately 100 points before stabilizing, while the Sensex dropped around 265 points to settle at 83,473. Despite a negative start, the market breadth remained relatively positive, with roughly 1,000 stocks advancing versus 700 declining.

In the IT sector, analysts anticipate growth to proceed at a sluggish pace, with small-cap IT stocks potentially outperforming mid-caps, which in turn may do better than large-cap IT firms. However, fundamental deterioration will likely be modest, averaging a 2-3% annual decline, yet growth will remain constrained for the foreseeable future. Despite this, some analysts foresee price and multiple corrections creating opportunities for selective investment.

Exide Industries appears attractive following a recent 20% decline, outpacing the Nifty's 3% dip, which has resulted in more favorable valuations. Nomura upgraded the stock to "Buy" with a target price of ₹398, citing healthy auto growth and an EBITDA match to expectations.

Bajaj Finance sold a stake in Bajaj Housing Finance for ₹14.892 crore during Q3, while also recording accelerated Expected Credit Loss (ECL) provisions of ₹1,400 crore. However, the management asserts that these provisions are made to safeguard the balance sheet against heightened customer leverage and rivalry, with credit costs projected at 165-175 bps for FY-24.

Lloyds Metals' Managing Director, Rajarish Gupta, has outlined the company's FY-26 outlook, anticipating iron-ore output to reach 26 Mt with EBITDA of approximately ₹7,500 crore. Combined, analysts anticipate total FY-26 EBITDA of ₹10,000-₹11,000 crore, a figure that aligns with management's expectations.

India and the US have reached a tariff deal, which marks a clear trend reversal after a 15-month slump in foreign investment inflows. Foreign investors are expected to return in a sustained manner, driven by reallocations within existing funds and a shift from higher-tariff to lower-tariff markets. The deal is expected to benefit sectors such as small-cap stocks tied to the tariff relief, as well as financials and lenders that can absorb sizable foreign positions.

Amidst the improving market sentiment, Amrut Distilleries, India's oldest whisky maker, aims to achieve net revenue of ₹750-800 crore by 2030, up from ₹610-615 crore projected for FY26. The company has expanded its distillation capacity by 30% to meet rising demand for premium single-malt and pure-malt whiskies, which now account for 35% of its turnover. However, the sales of aged stock will materialise only after five-six years due to long ageing periods, putting pressure on working capital.

In other news, Varun Beverages posted solid Q3 results despite seasonal softness and weather-related disruptions, but the stock closed about 4% lower despite broker recommendations remaining bullish. Brokers have provided their views on the stock, citing concerns over lower realisation due to higher discounts and competitive pressure, as well as positive volume growth outlook.

The key takeaways from Varun Beverages' Q3 results include volume growth remaining robust, offsetting a tough season, and margins being under pressure from SKU rationalisation and rising staff expenses. Management is confident about retaining margins and expects a strong FY2026, aided by a normal summer and continued international expansion. However, realisation weakness and pricing headwinds remain the main risks highlighted by brokers.

The recent broad sell-off in global tech stocks, driven by concerns about AI advances and their potential impact on SaaS firms and Indian outsourcing companies, has led to a sharp decline in major US IT stocks. Valuation correction or genuine threat, the drop is causing investors to worry about slower future revenue growth as AI agents may replace traditional software and services work. Despite recent earnings beating expectations, investors are concerned about the impact of AI-driven disintermediation on SaaS and services businesses.

The sell-off has been driven in part by AI-related news from Entropic and Anthropic, with Anthropic's revenue reportedly surging 10-fold. While some analysts see the drop as an overdone reaction, sentiment-driven underperformance persists, especially for Indian IT stocks. The sector remains vulnerable, even though Indian firms may not own foundational models, they could play a critical role in integrating AI into enterprise workflows.

Indian IT stocks have been under pressure for two years, and the market is pricing in the risk that earnings growth could stall. The sell-off has also led to a decline in the Nifty IT weight, with sentiment-driven pressure expected on the index. Despite this, flows turned positive, with FI flows amounting to ₹5,000 cr of cash-market buying and ₹40,000 cr of short-covering in index futures.

The India-US trade deal has cut most US tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%, giving Indian exporters a competitive edge over other Asian producers. However, section 232 tariffs remain largely unchanged, affecting steel, aluminum, and copper. The deal includes a five-year commitment for Indian purchases of US goods worth $500 billion and zero-tariff access for many Indian products.

The market reaction to the announcement has been mixed, with US equity indices falling, while investors shifted from growth stocks toward cyclical names. NASA's upcoming Artemis program is expected to achieve several milestones, including a crewed Moon landing in mid-2027, with Canadian astronauts Christina Cook and Jeremy Hanson joining the crew.

Asian markets are expected to open flat, with a focus on several key factors that will influence trading throughout the day. The GIFT Nifty suggests a subdued start for Indian markets, while strong buying activity by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in the previous session will be crucial to sustaining any potential upside. The Nifty index is struggling to stay above 26,000, with a support level at 25,500 posing a critical test.

The Bank Nifty has broken new highs, remaining above 60,000, with HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank needing to maintain this level. The rupee's recent single-day gain is the biggest since December 2018, requiring confirmation. The Indian currency's movement will likely impact FIIs' investment decisions and overall market sentiment.

Several company-specific updates will also influence trading. Bajaj Finance reported a 6% year-over-year decrease in net profit, while Restaurant Brands Asia suffered a net loss of ₹43.5 crore. V2 Retail recorded a 99% year-over-year increase in profit, while Nazara Technologies experienced a 36% decline in profit.

The market is expected to pay close attention to the earnings and corporate updates, as well as FII activity, support and resistance levels, the rupee's trajectory, and key economic indicators. Geo BlackRock Investment Advisors, a wealth-management platform offering fiduciary and low-cost advisory services to mass-affluent investors, is gaining attention for its unique business model and pricing strategy.

Geo BlackRock's platform is built using BlackRock's institutional tools integrated with India's fintech infrastructure, enabling the firm to scale fiduciary advice at a previously unavailable price point. The platform aims to democratize wealth management and reduce the high loss rate among retail investors. The US-India trade deal and ChrysCapital's investment in Bengaluru-based precision-manufacturing firm Nash Industries will also be closely monitored due to their potential impact on the market and the Indian manufacturing sector.

Investors are waiting for several key economic indicators, including the Nifty index's performance and the rupee's movement, before making any significant investment decisions.

A recent incident occurred at Mumbai's airport, involving two aircraft - an Air India A320 and an Indigo Airbus - that clipped each other's wingtips while taxiing. This incident occurred around 7 p.m. when the Air India aircraft was pushing back for departure, and the Indigo flight was taxiing to a parking bay after landing. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and all passengers were safely de-boarded and re-booked on alternate flights. The DGCA officials are conducting a detailed investigation to determine the cause of the incident, with early indications pointing to a coordination lapse between ground controllers and pilots. As a result of the incident, both aircraft have been grounded for technical inspections and repairs, and potential disciplinary actions for air-traffic-control or ground-operations staff may follow, pending the investigation's findings.

Meanwhile, a significant trade agreement has been reached between the United States and India, which is expected to boost trade and economic growth. The agreement outlines a first-phase trade deal, where U.S. tariffs on Indian goods fall from 50% to 18% for most industrial products, while India will keep existing tariffs on steel, autos, and other Section-232 items. The deal also includes a reduction in non-tariff barriers and an agreement for India to lower its tariffs on U.S. industrial goods, with around 98-99% of tariffs to be eliminated. Additionally, India is increasing imports of U.S. energy, including oil, gas, and propane, to diversify its supply sources.

The agreement has prompted a strong market response, with the Sensex and Nifty rising by more than 2% and the rupee moving towards the ₹90 per dollar level. Foreign institutional investors poured ₹5,400 crore into the market, and export-heavy sectors such as textiles, apparel, leather, and gems & jewellery are expected to benefit significantly from the trade deal. The agreement is also seen as a positive step for India's economy, which is expected to drive growth and increase trade volumes between the two countries.

Mandatory data sharing between Indian WhatsApp users and Meta outside of the country has been deemed in violation of Indian constitutional privacy rights by the Supreme Court of India. The decision stems from WhatsApp's 2021 privacy policy that mandated users to consent to data sharing with Meta or stop using the app, a move deemed an abuse of dominant position by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). A new Data Protection and Privacy (DPDP) Act, which gives companies until May 2027 to comply, has been cited as governing the matter, but the Court remains unsatisfied. WhatsApp and Meta must submit a formal response within one week, with a further hearing scheduled for 9 February to decide whether the company may continue sharing Indian user data.

Meanwhile, Indian agrochemical company Sharda Cropchem has posted a strong Q3 FY26 performance, with 14% volume growth and a gross margin of 35%. The company's strong cash balance, improved liquidity, and attractive valuation relative to peers have been highlighted. The India-US/EU trade deal is providing regulatory stability, supporting Sharda's growth narrative. The company remains cyclical, however, and thus maintains a neutral rating on most fronts, with a modest positive tilt on valuation.

In a separate development, full-stack resale-home platform Thruva has announced a $9 million funding round led by Stellaris and Oreos, with debt from Stride Ventures. The company claims to sell homes 7-10 times faster than the traditional market through staging properties and a distribution network. Thruva has facilitated ₹500 crore in resale value across seven Mumbai micro-markets and is expected to experience 6x growth this year, followed by 4x expansion next year.

A recent India-U.S. trade deal has had a positive impact on various sectors in India. The deal has reduced tariffs, with Indian gems and jewellery seeing an 18% tariff reduction, and solar equipment experiencing a cut in tariffs as well. This reduction in tariffs has led to a sharp rebound in demand for Indian gems and jewellery, with exports expected to return to the pre-tariff range of $8-9 billion in 2026.

The tariff cut has also had a positive effect on companies such as Recreation Jewels, with the company's Adil Kottwal expecting Indian exports to rebound and driven by strong financing capacity. The duty-free access to other markets, including Australia, the EU, the UK, and potentially Canada, is also expected to further enhance India's competitive position globally.

In the solar sector, companies such as Gyanesh Chaudhary's firm are expected to benefit from the tariff relief, which is expected to restore lost export volume, improve competitiveness against Chinese rivals, and lift EBITDA by 2-3% over the next few years. The company plans to accelerate its international sales pipeline, expand upstream manufacturing in India, and explore a joint-venture plant in Colorado.

The India-U.S. trade deal has also had a positive impact on the electronics sector, with the 18% reciprocal U.S. tariff benefiting Indian companies such as Amitron Electronics. The company's founder, Mukesh Jayram Vasani, explained that the tariff will help Amitron expand its global footprint and enable the company to manufacture both in the U.S. and India.

The recent 2026 budget has also allocated ₹2.2 lakh crore for defence capital outlay, a 22-24% increase over the previous year. This signals strong, long-term confidence from the government, reinforcing the push for self-reliance and accelerating both emergency procurements and major programme timelines.

The budget's allocation for defence capital outlay is expected to have a positive impact on companies in the sector, with Amitron's pipeline of ₹20-30 billion over the next 18-24 months remaining realistic. The uncertainties associated with the defence sector have largely been cleared, turning short-term opportunities into sustained, long-term growth prospects.

The India-US trade deal has eliminated punitive tariffs, giving Indian exporters a price edge, which is expected to benefit companies integrated into US supply chains such as Bharat Forge, Pearl Global, and Aarti Industries. The deal also aligns with recent EU agreements, expanding market opportunities and signaling a broader, long-term boost to India's manufacturing and export sectors.

Market sentiment remains broadly positive, with earnings driving activity. Various companies have reported strong quarterly results, including Varun Beverages, which posted 14% year-over-year revenue growth and a 33% profit rise, although the stock experienced a sharp decline. Ather Energy delivered strong Q3 results, with a 1,600 bps year-over-year margin expansion and 53% income growth, causing its shares to jump. Interarch Buildings reported a 43% year-over-year revenue increase and a book value of over ₹1,650 crore, pushing the stock higher. City Union Bank stood out among private banks with a 28% profit growth, while Utkarsh Small Finance Bank continued to post quarterly losses.

Tax-related developments include changes to the Income Tax Return (ITR) deadlines, with salaried individuals' ITR-1/2 due on July 31 and non-audit individuals' ITR-3/4/5/6 due on August 31. The return-type timelines have been updated, with belated returns due on December 31, revised returns due on March 31, and updated returns (ITRU) due within 24 months after the assessment year.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) council has reduced the tax rates on foreign tour packages and travel from 5% to 2%, and liberalized the remittance scheme for education and medical expenses. The Tax Deductibility at Source (TDS) rate for NRI property transactions has also been removed, allowing buyers to file Form 26QB directly. Additionally, automatic, faster, lower-TDS certificates will be introduced for NRI seller transactions.

Foreign income and assets disclosure will be possible on a voluntary basis, with a six-month window for filing, attracting minimal penalty and avoiding prosecution. The government has announced plans to replace the term "Assessment Year" with "Financial Year" in tax bills, simplifying language without altering substance. The Securities Transaction Tax (STT) will be applied to curb speculative F&O trading, treating F&O income as business income in the tax return.

Soham Asset Management's Sanjay Parik discussed the fund's performance and outlook following recent market movements. The fund was well-positioned before the surprise trade deal and has maintained a cyclical, value-oriented portfolio, with low cash levels and a focus on infrastructure, metals, and steel stocks. Parik expects the recovery of the economy to continue, driven by economic indicators such as rising cement, steel, and power demand, and strong credit growth.

Infrastructure and capex stocks remain attractive, despite deep discounts on many infra stocks, due to working-capital delays and state-level payment issues. Current entry points are appealing, although the sector's recovery hinges on improved cash cycles. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) are expected to return if earnings growth sustains, as valuations have corrected and the macro backdrop becomes more favorable. Metals and steel stocks are expected to benefit from protective duties, pricing power, and demergers, including SOTP of Edanta.

The fund has exited Indus Towers after capitalizing on price moves, citing reduced Vodafone-related risk and slower growth prospects, although the business remains attractive for future re-entry.

The BSE posted its biggest single-day gain since May 12, 2025, with the NIFTY experiencing a 2.5 percent surge, driven largely by positive earnings news and sentiment shift following a truce. The market capitalization of companies listed on the BSE expanded by approximately ₹12.5 lakh crore, reflecting the significant increase in stock prices. Approximately 2,500 stocks recorded an upward trend, while about 450 stocks reported a decline.

Market observers attribute the rally to a combination of factors, including earnings news, particularly positive reactions from Mobiwit, Adani Ports, and other Adani group firms, and the rupee's strength. The Indian rupee showed significant improvement following an overnight truce, contributing to the positive sentiment in the market. Several top gainers, including various Adani group firms, reported substantial gains, with Reliance Industries rising by approximately 8 percent.

In contrast, a few companies, such as PB FinTech and Varun Beverages, continued to experience losses, with PB FinTech recording its third consecutive loss day, its share price falling 11 percent over the last three sessions. Varun Beverages posted a 24 percent decline from its 52-week high of ₹600, with its volume increasing to approximately 2.5 crore shares.

Gold prices surged by 4.2 percent, primarily attributed to Chinese speculative buying, following a significant drop of 4.8 percent. The World Gold Council sees gold as a long-term portfolio diversifier, expecting continued demand, particularly in the investment segment, driven by growing tech-related gold use and central-bank interest.

The Indian government allocated ₹20,000 crore for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) in the 2026 budget to curb emissions from steel, refineries, and chemicals. This move aims to scale up the CCUS technology, enabling Indian exporters to avoid EU carbon-border taxes. 

The India-US trade deal was announced, which will see a reduction in tariffs on India from 40% to 18%. Amit Kalyani, GMD of Bharat Forge, views the deal as restorative to the company's long-term growth, citing the removal of tariff uncertainty and clarity for future growth prospects. Barclays and Bank of America have projected improved GDP growth for India, with Barclays estimating FY26-27 growth at 6.5% and Bank of America projecting an upside risk to FY27 growth of approximately 6.8%.

A recent India-US trade deal has been signed, removing the tariff overhang on previously affected sectors, such as gems, jewelry, apparel, and auto components. The removal of this uncertainty is seen as symbolically important by Nilkan Mishra, who notes that many exports were already exempt from tariffs and growing. However, he cautions that the overall economic effect will be incremental and that a significant share of trade was already tariff-free.

The agreement is expected to boost sentiment and reduce currency-linked market volatility, although a balanced view suggests it is not a game-changer for the broader economy. The deal may provide modest benefits for non-tech FDI, services exports, and the Indian rupee's stability, with the expected bilateral trade to reach roughly $500 billion over several years.

A favorable market sentiment is also reflected in the rupee's potential appreciation to around 88/USD within the next month-to-six weeks, driven by improved trade flows and market sentiment, as stated by Abhishek Goenka. Meanwhile, the RBI may step in to buy dollars despite depleted reserves, supported by expected capital inflows.

In terms of business developments, PB Fintech is expected to announce a fundraise of over ₹3,000 crore to support its planned overseas acquisition of a UK or European insurance product-distribution and aggregation firm. Additionally, Advent International will invest ₹2,750 crore in Aditya Birla Housing Finance via its entity Indria Limited.

Intellect Design Arena's Q3 earnings showed muted margin growth, prompting a sell-off, although Chairman Arun Jain explained that large, multi-year contracts can cause short-term fluctuations. The company's performance should be assessed on a last-twelve-month (LTM) basis, resulting in revenue reaching ₹3,000 crore (up 23%), margin growing 33%, and cash rising 49%.

The Indian chemicals sector is anticipated to benefit from recent trade developments, particularly the removal of tariffs on exports to the European Union and the reduction of tariffs on exports to the United States. Approximately 20% of Indian chemical exports currently go to the US, with 17% being shipped to the EU. The decrease in tariffs is expected to enhance the sector's competitiveness and provide a boost to its growth prospects. 

Domestic policy initiatives, including the establishment of new chemical parks and a favorable budget, are also seen as key drivers of growth for the sector. The acquisition of Jayhawk, a US-based chemicals company, by Anupam Rasayan is expected to expand the company's product range and provide improved supply-chain options for customers in both India and the US. This acquisition has become particularly advantageous due to the new trade environment, which provides lower and more predictable tariffs.

The trade deal between India and the US is also seen as significant, with tariffs expected to decline from around 25% to roughly 18%. This reduction is projected to positively impact the Indian economy, with a boost to its macro outlook and a direct impact on GDP growth. Private sector investment and supply-chain re-shoring are also expected to increase as a result of the trade deal, potentially raising FY27 growth by 25-30 basis points.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to remain neutral on interest rates and reduce the need for open-market operations, given lower export-import pressure and anticipated foreign investment inflows. The RBI may also use this opportunity to trim its short-forward dollar book and rebuild foreign exchange reserves. 

The rupee is expected to appreciate and move into the ₹88-₹89 per US dollar band, up from the recent ₹91-₹92 level. The RBI is anticipated to intervene modestly to prevent excessive appreciation and rebuild FX reserves. 

The Indian gem-and-jewellery sector is also seen as a beneficiary of the trade deal, with the chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council welcoming the elimination of tariffs on loose diamonds and jewellery. The sector is expecting a surge in retail expansion, with 70,000 Indian-run outlets already operating in the US, and more expected to open.

A trade deal between the U.S. and India has significantly impacted the country's textile exporters, with exports of Indian apparel to the U.S. witnessing a reduction in tariffs from 50% to 18%. This development led to a rally in shares of companies involved in the textile and apparel sector, with several of them experiencing a surge in retail and mutual fund participation. Stocks such as Gokaldas Exports, Welspun, and Indo-Count have seen significant gains, although they still remain far below their pre-trade deal highs.

The new trade deal has also led to an increase in exports of chemicals, particularly Aarti Industries, which has seen a boost in its revenues due to reduced U.S. duties on chemical exports. Additionally, companies involved in the marine and shrimp sectors, such as Avanti Feeds, have also experienced gains following the trade deal. The agreement has also been seen as a positive for the Indian economy, with experts stating that it would reduce uncertainty related to trade and attract foreign direct investment into the non-tech sector.

The trade deal has also led to a significant increase in the country's manufacturing sector, with companies such as Torral India exemplifying the transition from a service-oriented economy to a high-precision, export-driven manufacturing powerhouse. The company's speed, scale, and execution in building a world-class foundry in Chakan and a second plant in Supa have been particularly impressive. The company's partnership with the state of Maharashtra's Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has also been seen as a significant development in the government's efforts to become the country's defence-manufacturing leader.

The trade deal has also had a positive impact on the Indian currency, with experts stating that it would aid in the country's ability to keep its rupee stable. The deal has also been seen as a positive for the country's housing finance sector, with a major deal involving Aditya Birla Capital and Advent being announced recently. However, the deal is expected to soften as profit-taking sets in, although fundamentals remain supportive.

The success of various Indian companies has been notable, with RGBSI, founded by Dr. Nanuwa Singh, expanding globally to serve clients in 41 countries, delivering engineering, quality, and software solutions. Built on core principles such as total commitment, work without attachment, selfless service, and transparency, global scaling relied on winning large U.S. contracts and placing trusted local leaders in new markets. Dr. Singh's advice to engineers-turned-entrepreneurs emphasizes the importance of embracing responsibility, relentless commitment, continuous learning, and a purpose beyond monetary gain.

In the digital-security space, Accops, co-founded by Vijayendra Yadav and Mohan Bhatt, has developed a "Made-in-India" solution to address Indian regulatory needs while being globally applicable. The company has leveraged strategic partnerships and developed native products, such as VDI and enterprise authentication, to provide a security-first, sovereign solution. Accops emphasizes purpose-driven remote work and employee pride in delivering superior Indian technology.

Bharat Forge, a leading manufacturer, is expected to benefit from the new U.S.-India trade deal, with exports projected to rise significantly in the upcoming fiscal year. The company is also expanding its manufacturing facility in Andhra Pradesh and has seen a recent dip in commercial-vehicle demand, although exports are expected to rebound in the near term.

Ather Energy, an electric scooter manufacturer, has shown a significant improvement in its EBITDA margin and has been expanding its market share. The company aims to increase its non-vehicle revenue, driven mainly by software sales, and is working to reduce fixed costs and improve productivity. Key outlook points for Ather Energy include breakeven in EBITDA, which is expected to be achieved in the next few quarters, and a targeted market share of over 20% in the near term.

Bajaj Auto posts a strong Q3 performance, with revenue and profit increasing by approximately 19%, driven by improved EBITDA margin of 20.8%. The company's exports, mainly under the Triumph and KTM brands, represent a small share of total sales, but the recent India-U.S. trade deal and removal of tariffs are positively received. Bajaj expects to shift more U.S.-focused production to India, which will benefit from the tariff removal, and aims to maintain or slightly increase export volumes in Q4 and FY27.

Commodity price inflation is offset by flat steel, rubber, and natural product costs, while a weak rupee provides a margin tailwind, enabling the company to sustain baseline margins of 20%+. The company regains 5 percentage points of market share in the EV two-wheeler segment, returning to a solid No. 2 position. A new Chetak C25 scooter has been launched, bolstering the Chetak line, and three-wheelers have also seen a rapid rebound, regaining the No. 1 spot with approximately 38% market share in the e-auto segment.

Quant Mutual Fund's CIO, Sandeep Tandon, views the recent rally in the rupee and Indian markets as driven by restored sentiment rather than a sudden fundamental shift, with the underlying macro picture remaining strong. He expects the rupee's move toward the 92-per-dollar level to be a "peak" rather than a breakdown, anticipating the rupee to appreciate as India's economy outpaces both developed and other emerging markets.

PG ElectroPlus reports modest 8% revenue growth in H1 FY26, followed by a strong Q3 rebound of 45-46% in room-air-conditioning (RAC) sales, driven by channel-filling ahead of the January 2026 energy-rating change. Management expects Q4 inventory to be cleared as the summer season begins in South India, while channel inventory remains high but is expected to normalize by February-March.

Aarti Industries CEO Surya Kotecha explains that the United States accounts for approximately 20% of the company's global chemical exports and about 17-18% of its total revenue, with recent tariff reductions improving cost competitiveness, especially versus Chinese exporters who still face near-50% duties. The company has achieved 14-15% YTD revenue growth with margins near 13-14%, and has raised its capital-expenditure target to approximately ₹1,100 crore, focusing on energy and polymer capacity expansion.

A new US-India trade agreement is expected to have a significant impact on Indian textile exports to the US. Tariffs on Indian engineering exports, previously subject to a 25% duty under Section 232, are slated to drop to 18%. This decrease is expected to boost exports for various Indian companies, including those in the oil-and-gas and industrial-equipment sectors. The agreement may also exempt auto components, which could further benefit Indian engineering exports.

Other sectors, such as metal, are also expected to benefit from the trade deal. While the 50% tariff on aluminum and steel under Section 232 remains unchanged, indirect export sentiment for the metal sector has improved. The Indian metal sector is also expected to benefit from growing demand and favorable commodity prices. ICICI Securities has projected a modestly bullish view on Hindustan Zinc and Vedanta, citing potential benefits from the trade deal.

The agreement is also expected to boost the solar sector, with Indian companies such as Waaree Energies and Vikram Solar set to benefit from increased exports. Capital-goods firms, including Apar Industries and Cummins India, are also expected to benefit from the deal, as they derive a significant portion of their revenue from exports.

Indian textile exporters, particularly those in the US market, are expected to benefit significantly from the tariff removal. The effective tariff for Indian textile exporters will drop to roughly 2% lower than their competitors, leading to a 15-18% improvement in bottom-line profitability. This is likely to lead to increased top-line growth as the cost advantage rekindles demand.

The trade agreement is seen as a significant turning point for the Indian textile sector, particularly in light of recent EU-India trade concessions and government reforms aimed at enhancing India's export competitiveness. These reforms include easier capital access, labor law flexibility, and improved availability of raw materials, among others.

A recent video by Wadhwani AI highlighted the company's use of artificial intelligence to improve reading fluency for primary-school children in India. The platform has scaled to millions of users and is being integrated into state competency-based assessments. The team is also exploring expanding the technology nationwide and adding comprehension analysis.

The newly announced India-U.S. trade deal has been hailed as a major catalyst that revives market sentiment. It is expected to boost corporate profit growth, improve the rupee, and encourage foreign-institutional participation. The deal is seen as a positive step, but further bilateral talks and sector-specific resolutions are needed to translate the tariff cut into lasting, economy-wide gains.

The deal's impact is expected to be felt across various sectors. Large-cap and liquid Nifty names are expected to be the first beneficiaries, with money flowing into big and liquid stocks. Export-oriented sectors such as textiles, engineering, and certain financial services are likely to gain from reduced U.S. tariffs. IT services, on the other hand, are seen as neutral, gaining from a weaker rupee but not directly affected by tariffs.

The buy-back rule change, which makes promoter buybacks more attractive, is also expected to support share prices. Companies are expected to announce buybacks quickly, sucking cash out of the market and supporting share prices. Foreign investors, who have been driven by valuation concerns and rupee weakness, are likely to return to large-cap stocks as valuations improve and the currency stabilises.

The trade deal is expected to trigger a relief rally for export-driven firms that saw 30-40% top-line declines. Section 232 restrictions remain, however, affecting a modest share of trade but still matter for autos, steel, and related industries. The deal is also expected to impact energy, with India shifting from discounted Russian crude to U.S. and Venezuelan supplies.

Textile stocks, in particular, are expected to gain from the trade deal. Indian textile firms have high exposure to the U.S. market, with names such as Indocount Industries, Gokaldas, Pearl Global, Welspun, and Himatsuka Seed having approximately 60-70% U.S. exposure. Auto and auto ancillaries are also expected to benefit, with companies such as Sona PLW and Samvardhana Motherson having significant U.S. exposure.

The Nifty and Sensex indices surged in response to the trade deal, with a large number of stocks participating in the rally. The move was likened to past market spikes after the 10% corporate-tax cut and the May 12, 2025 post-ceasefire rally. The advance-decline ratio was extreme, with approximately 10 advancing stocks for every 1 declining.

A recent U.S.-Indian trade deal has led to a significant reduction in tariffs, from approximately 50% to 18%, allowing Indian exporters to increase their competitiveness in the global market. The reduction has been particularly beneficial for companies with significant U.S. exposure, including textile exporters such as Gokuldas Exports, Wellspun Living, and KPR Mill. This decrease in tariffs is expected to improve profitability and strengthen order books for these companies, thereby improving their competitiveness against other countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China.

In the chemicals sector, companies reliant on U.S. exports, such as SRF, Naveen Fluorine, and Neogen Chemicals, have faced uncertainty and decreased sales due to U.S. tariffs. However, the new trade deal is expected to alleviate this situation by reducing many of these tariffs. Although battery-chemical items are excluded from the tariff list, approximately 18% of products remain subject to duties.

The U.S. tariff cut has also had a positive impact on oil imports, with Indian oil marketers increasing U.S. crude imports while reducing purchases from Russia. Reliance has historically sourced around 20% of its crude from Venezuela and may see a significant discount if it were to renew ties with the country, potentially boosting its gross refining margin.

Indian auto makers and suppliers, including Tata Motors, Bharat Forge, and SONA and BLW, have seen their export viability enhanced due to the reduced tariffs. These companies derive a substantial portion of their sales from the U.S. and are expected to benefit from the improved trade terms.

The trade agreement has also been viewed positively by experts, with Ed Yardeni and Matt Orton describing it as a major win for the U.S. and India, and a strategic loss for Russia and China. The reduction in tariffs is expected to boost India's economy, corporate earnings, and stock market performance, thereby improving foreign investor sentiment and attracting incremental funds over the next three-to-five years.

In addition, the trade deal has been seen as complementing India's new tax holiday for foreign data-center investors, helping to dispel the "anti-AI" perception and positioning India for AI and cloud growth. Furthermore, supportive fiscal and monetary policies, including an anticipated RBI rate cut, are expected to facilitate dollar inflows and contribute to a stronger domestic and foreign demand.

Recent developments in India's economy and financial sector are noteworthy, with various factors contributing to the country's growth prospects. Public-sector banks are increasingly involved in large deals, and a proposal to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) ceiling for state-owned banks is pending government approval. Enhancing the capital of public-sector banks through increased equity infusion is seen as a means to boost credit flow.

The success of the mobile-manufacturing scheme is being studied for replication, with critical lessons learned. These include reaching a critical mass before attempting deep localization and focusing on value-addition within the sector, while accepting that some components may remain in global supply chains. Building a resilient, diversified supply base from multiple sources is also essential for scaling manufacturing efforts.

India's smartphone industry has achieved significant growth, with the country now ranking among the top three global smartphone manufacturers. However, the absence of a strong national consumer brand hinders the development of a "national champion." The Ministry aims to nurture more Indian product companies, not just contract manufacturers, to capture higher value-addition and control over the market.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has defended the budget in a post-budget interview, justifying the rise in securities transaction tax on futures and options as a deterrent to speculation. The minister also reiterated the goal of achieving the ₹80 000 crore divestment target and signaled openness to tax holidays for global firms setting up data-centers.

In the financial markets, the rupee experienced a significant rise of 48 paise to ₹91.47/USD, with a broad recovery in commodities easing short-covering pressure. Conversely, the bond market reacted negatively to the budget-announced borrowing of ₹17.2 lakh crore, resulting in a sell-off and a rise in yields. Equity markets, however, experienced a moderate increase, with the Sensex and Nifty each rising around 1%.

The Budget 2026-27 presented by the government outlines initiatives to boost economic growth, focusing on export-led development. A public capital outlay of ₹12.2 lakh crore is allocated, with a fiscal deficit target of 4.3% of GDP. The budget prioritizes development of high-value sectors, including biopharma, semiconductors, rare earths, textiles, and data centres, while supporting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to upgrade their capabilities and move up the global value chain.

Massive capex, long-term tax incentives, export-friendly customs and finance measures, and new free trade agreements (FTAs) with the EU, UK, and UAE are some of the policy levers aimed at enhancing India's export competitiveness. Key initiatives include the ₹10,000 crore Biopharma Shakti program, the ₹40,000 crore Semiconductor Mission, the rare-earth corridor, and the data-centre tax holiday.

Experts and industry representatives have generally welcomed the budget's focus on export-driven growth, but have emphasized the need for effective execution, particularly in ensuring the reliability of infrastructure, clean energy availability, sector-specific incentives, and integrating tier-2 and tier-3 suppliers into global value chains.

Notable concerns have also been raised about the engineering and steel sectors, with calls for stronger procurement rules to promote their involvement in global value chains. Additionally, issues related to power reliability, clean energy access, and data-flow regulations have been identified as constraints for digital-services exports.

A recent incident involving a fuel-control switch on a Boeing 787 operated by Air India has sparked a debate over the potential causes of accidents, with possible faults in the aircraft or pilot error being considered. While Air India has stressed the importance of passenger safety, regulatory bodies and industry experts continue to investigate the issue.

The performance of Motherson Sumi Wiring, MSW, a joint venture between Indian and Japanese companies, is characterized by solid top-line growth and excellent profitability ratios. Its balance sheet is stable, with negligible debt and a substantial cash reserve of approximately INR 238 crore. However, the company faces short-term margin pressure and cash-flow weakness due to a shift in product mix and higher input costs.

The analysis suggests that MSW's stock price has underperformed, with a total return of around 12% in the last year and 43% since the demerger. The company's valuation is on the cheaper side relative to its peers, which could be a positive indicator. Key growth drivers for MSW include a government tax cut, potential opportunities arising from the India-EU trade deal, and an ongoing plant expansion plan.

A thorough review of the company's performance reveals a stable shareholding structure and a relatively modest return on equity. The plant expansion at Navagam, which is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of FY 26, is anticipated to contribute positively to the company's revenue. Additionally, the planned expansion of the Pune plant is expected to recover in the next 2-3 quarters once customers raise new orders.

The 2026 budget has been met with a mixed reaction in the market. While it includes several positive initiatives, such as increased infrastructure spending and a tax holiday for data center investors, the unexpected rise in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has had a negative impact on liquidity and sentiment. The increase from 0% to 0.05% on futures and options has hurt investors, leading to a widening of bid-ask spreads and dampened market sentiment.

The proposed merger of Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (RAC) could potentially erase the current discount on PFC, leading to significant changes in the market. Additionally, high government borrowings in FY 27 may push bond yields up, potentially affecting the treasury income of Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks, such as State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, and Punjab National Bank.

The RBI is expected to continue its support for the market by conducting Open Market Operations (OMOs) to manage liquidity and manage the supply of government redemptions. The RBI may need to intervene with bond-buybacks and continue variable Reverse Repo Rates to maintain liquidity in the system. The inflation projection for the next year remains within the RBI's comfort band, and the RBI is expected to maintain a "lower-for-longer" stance in monetary policy.

The Union Budget's market impact has been a mixed bag. The introduction of a 0.05% Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options has been a notable feature. This change is expected to raise transaction costs, widen spreads, and potentially deter high-frequency trading. 

The budget has also provided a significant boost to sectoral capital expenditure, particularly for railways, power, and defence. Furthermore, a 21-year tax holiday to encourage foreign investment in data centers has been introduced. Analysts have identified this as a long-term equity theme with substantial potential.

On the other hand, the projected total borrowing need of ₹17.2 lakh crore has put upward pressure on sovereign yields and borrowing costs in the bond market. The rupee has also been affected, and despite RBI's support, foreign investors' expectations for capital-gain tax relief have not been met. 

The budget has also made changes to buyback taxation, which may relieve the tax burden for retail investors and potentially revive buyback activity. A ₹10,000 crore "Bioshakti" scheme has been launched to establish India as a biologics hub. The budget has also introduced various initiatives to promote medical tourism and improve liquidity for Indians spending abroad.

The government has also clarified that the STT increase aims to target speculative trading, with approximately 90% of participants reportedly losing money. The disinvestment and asset monetization process has been approved, with the cabinet aiming to drive revenue through public-float in central enterprises.

Key sectors such as nuclear power and gold and silver have been impacted by global uncertainties, with central banks increasing their holdings of these metals. The government has also set a target of 4.5% fiscal deficit, capping expenditure at ₹53 lakh crore. The Indian rupee's performance remains under close monitoring by the Finance Ministry and the RBI. 

Additionally, the banking sector is expected to benefit from a high-quality asset base, and a high-level committee has been set up for bank consolidation. The buyback taxation rules aim to protect minority shareholders' interests. The implementation of IBC amendments is expected to be introduced in the second half of the budget session.

The market has experienced a significant uptick, with the Nifty up approximately 265 points to 26,090, and the Sensex near 81,620. The market breadth was slightly negative, but the long list of gainers kept the board green. The sectoral strength came from Capital Markets, CPSC, and Autos, with key winners including Power Grid, Tata Motors, Adani Ports, Tata Consumer, and Hindustan Zinc.

A discussion centered on the impact of the new Securities Transaction Tax (STT) changes on trading volumes and arbitrage funds. It is noted that the tax increase of about 5 basis points on the sell side translates to a negligible reduction in returns for arbitrage funds, which is approximately 0.03-0.05% monthly. Retail speculators trading a few lots of options will feel an impact of only a few rupees. As a result, the STT change is expected to have a minimal effect on both retail participants and institutional arbitrage players.

The 2024 Union Budget announced a tax holiday for foreign cloud-service providers that use data centers located in India, lasting until 2047. The exemption applies only to the income arising from services delivered via Indian data-center capacity and is conditioned on the ownership by an Indian company and approval by the government. A 15% safe-harbor margin (cost + 15%) was introduced for transfer-pricing purposes when a foreign cloud provider pays an Indian data-center operator for the use of space.

Experts note that while the tax incentives alone will not make India a data-center hub, reliable power, water, streamlined approvals, and a coherent national data-center policy are equally critical. Comparisons with Malaysia show that power availability, coordinated ministries, and clear sustainability standards are decisive factors.

PB FinTech is expected to raise a large amount of capital to fund the acquisition of an international insurance aggregator operating in the same sector as its Indian business. Advent International is reportedly set to invest about $300 million for a minority stake in Aditya Birla Housing Finance to improve its balance sheet and support loan-book growth. 

The market's recent oversold condition is not surprising after yesterday's sharp drop, with the PSA falling below 0.6. Large foreign investors are not expected to be heavy sellers; instead, there is mixed activity, including some small buying in select large-caps and modest selling focused on private-bank names, NDFCs, and defense stocks after the budget.

Insecticides India reported a quarterly revenue growth of 8%, a decline from 5% in Q1 and 2% in Q2, and a nine-month growth of 5%, falling short of its FY26 guidance of 10% top-line growth. The company has revised its FY26 revenue growth to around 5-6%, acknowledging that meeting the original target is "very difficult". 

The premium segment growth has been cut from 20% to 10%, and margins are unlikely to improve significantly due to the cyclical nature of the business. The sector faces strong demand and pricing pressure, compounded by erratic weather and a 2-3% industry-wide decline. 

In contrast, Arvind Ltd. has reported a 14% YoY growth in revenue, with EBITDA up 15% in its recent Q3 results. The company has been aided by cost-saving measures, volume offsets, and a favorable dollar rate, with margins remaining around 11.5%. 

MedPlus Health, on the other hand, has posted a strong Q3, with healthy revenue and margins and double-digit same-store sales growth. The boost came from easing supply-chain constraints after rapid expansion and a deliberate slowdown of deep discounting on private-label medicines. 

The company added 182 stores in the quarter and targets 600-plus outlets by FY26, planning to open 600-1,000 stores annually at a cost below ₹250 crore. It will fund this from its sizable cash pile and prefers to retain the cash for faster growth rather than issue dividends or buybacks. Private-label sales grew 22% in contribution, but the firm will moderate its push on private-label pharma, focusing more on branded and general-goods categories. 

Arvind Ltd's Vice-Chairman, Puneet Lalbhai, believes that the Indian government's mega textile parks and related skilling initiatives will complement forthcoming free-trade agreements (FTAs), potentially boosting exports, particularly to the UK and Europe.

Market indices in India have shown resilience, with the Nifty hovering near 25,000 and the Sensex gaining 550 points. The indices have been led by top gainers such as Adani Ports, Power Grid, L&T, and Reliance, but sectoral divergence persists. Market participants have expressed mixed reactions to the recent budget, with broader indices recovering from lows but struggling to break the 24,900 mark. Mid-Caps and Small-Caps, however, have faced significant selling pressure, highlighting the heightened volatility in these segments.

The budget includes measures aimed at boosting manufacturing, such as offsetting 50% of US tariffs, and increasing spending on data-centre incentives. The government has also confirmed that it is considering strategic disinvestment in several public sector undertakings (PSUs), including IDBI Bank. The analysis of 80+ listed PSUs reveals excess government holdings worth approximately Rs 27.5 lakh crore, with the largest potential unlock value lying in companies such as LIC, SBI, HAL, ONGC, and IRFC.

The external environment has been affected by global economic concerns, with Asian markets experiencing a sell-off and Brent crude prices declining by around 4.5-5%. The RBI's external accounts remain stable, with strong FDI inflows offsetting short-term FPI outflows. The debate on rupee intervention continues, with the current level around the 90-per-dollar mark under close watch.

Varun Lohchab, Head of Institutional Research at HDFC Securities, has expressed a positive view on the capital-market space for the medium term, citing the recent shift in buyback taxation and the revival of buyback activity as potential drivers of growth. In a separate development, Sun Pharma's Q3 results showed a 30% revenue surge and expanding margins, driven in part by the Indian government's biotech push. The company also confirmed that it is on track to meet its FY26 guidance and highlighted its plans for innovative medicines in the coming months.

The Indian government has set a disinvestment target of ₹80,000 crore for fiscal year 2027, aiming to reduce its holdings in numerous public sector undertakings (PSUs). To achieve this goal, the government is considering a sell-down of its stakes in several PSUs, potentially reducing its holding below 51%. An analysis of 84 listed PSUs reveals that the government's current holdings exceed a 26% floor, resulting in a potential upside of ₹27.5 lakh crore if the floor is applied uniformly.

The largest contributors to the excess-stake pool include LIC, SBI, HAL, Concorde, ONGC, and IRFC, with the government holding significant stakes in these companies. However, divesting large stakes in top-held firms will be complex and time-consuming, and sensitive sectors such as defence and railways raise national-security and policy concerns about external shareholders.

The government has historically missed previous disinvestment targets, making the current goal a challenging stretch. The size of the asset pool and sector sensitivities will determine how much of the ₹80,000 crore target can actually be realised.

The Union Budget announcement has had a mixed impact on the market, with the Nifty trading in a tight range and hovering around 24,900 at close. PSU banks, healthcare, and IT were among the few sectors with any upside, while metals, pharma, media, and NBFCs lagged. The Securities Transaction Tax (STT) hike in the F&O segment has sparked sentiment pressure, particularly for arbitrage funds.

Market participants are awaiting further information on buy-back tax changes and the impact of the STT hike on long-term investors. Commodity prices have suffered a correction, with gold falling below $4,550/oz and silver below $74/oz. Analysts advise limiting exposure to stand-alone metal bets and maintaining a 10-15% allocation to gold and silver in diversified portfolios.

The post-budget trajectory of PSU divestments will be closely watched, as will further STT impact, buy-back activity, and commodity prices.

The 2026 Union Budget has been criticized for its lack of recognition of the equity market's significance. It has been viewed as treating the equity market merely as a by-product of other industry policies. The modest increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options has been seen as an "irritant" that signals the government's disregard for the market's systemic importance. 

The current market has been underperforming, with the rupee weakening, FII outflows accelerating, and the small-cap index down approximately 8.5% YTD. Overseas investors have lost over 20% on currency movements. A senior executive at Helios Capital, Samir Arora, has argued that the stock market deserves targeted support, such as tax relief on cash-market STT, long-term capital-gains incentives, or broader liquidity measures, rather than a blanket "no-action" stance. 

However, Arora notes that the budget did include measures benefiting certain sectors, which will allow his funds to capitalize on those allocations. Nonetheless, he emphasizes the need for the government to recognize the equity market as a strategic sector and provide concrete policy tools to sustain FII inflows and domestic liquidity. 

On a positive note, India's household savings rate remains high, approximately 20%, supporting infrastructure and long-term asset creation. Additionally, a shift has occurred from pure savers to savers-who-invest, driven by greater financial literacy. The life-insurance industry has seen stable fundamentals, with insurance channels accounting for approximately 17-18% of India's overall savings pool.

However, a significant protection gap exists in India, with a sum-assured-to-GDP ratio of only 25-26%. Approximately 80% of households lack term-insurance coverage, with adequate protection requiring roughly 10 times a household's annual income. Cultural reliance on gold and other real assets limits insurance uptake. 

Term insurance is viewed as a critical product, with massive upside potential, as only 10-12% of Indian tax-filers currently own term policies. Awareness of term insurance has risen from approximately 30% to 70% over six years, but ownership lags behind at approximately 30%. Retirement planning is also a significant concern, with approximately 48 out of 100 Indians scoring poorly on retirement preparedness. 

The growth drivers for the next 5-10 years are centered around consumer nudges and education, distribution expansion, and policy and tax incentives. Industry stakeholders request adjustments to ATC limits for inflation, preservation of GST-zero on term insurance, and tax relief for annuity principals. Regulatory bodies, such as IRDAI, have supported balanced sector growth, with the recent GST reduction on term insurance boosting sales. 

Finally, industry participants have expressed expectations regarding the budget, which include preserving or raising the ATC limit to maintain tax incentives effective, introducing nudges for combined protection-savings products, and providing tax relief on the principal of annuity payouts to improve retirement dignity.

Market sentiment remains volatile as Brigade Enterprises faces uncertainty in meeting its FY-26 growth target of 15-20%. The company's dependence on Q4 project launches is a critical factor, with approximately 50% of quarterly sales coming from new projects. Although delayed launches have contributed to bookings falling 15% YoY, the slowdown is not attributed to a broader market weakness, but rather a shift in demand towards premium housing.

Brigade Enterprises' management, led by MD Pavithra Shankar, has expressed optimism about the company's prospects despite the challenges. The company plans to target 4-5 million square feet of launches in the next two quarters, with a bulk of the 12 million square feet planned for FY-26 expected in Q4. The focus remains on South-India markets, specifically Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad, with no immediate plans to enter the NCR market.

In other market developments, the unexpected Securities Transaction Tax (STT) hike has had a limited impact on the market, with a 3 bp hike on futures and 2.5 bp on options translating to roughly 60 bp annual cost for hedge funds. The market's initial knee-jerk sell-off should revert to a focus on the government's growth-supportive policies and macro fundamentals.

The Indian government's budget has introduced several positive elements, including a valuation discount, strong earnings growth, and a favorable policy environment. India's EM-premium has Fallen, and its price-to-S&P-500 ratio is now at a discount. The PEG ratio is improving, approaching double-digit earnings growth, making valuations more attractive.

IDFC First Bank has reported a strong Q3, driven by a 12-bp fall in cost of funds and aggressive savings-rate cuts. The bank aims to maintain its CASA ratio within a 45-50% comfort zone, with a goal to bring its credit-deposit ratio down to the 80s as loan growth stays around 20-23% and deposit growth remains above 25%.

The Union Minister has outlined two semiconductor missions, 1.0 and 2.0, aimed at strengthening India's semiconductor ecosystem and deepening the supply chain. Mission 1.0 focuses on bringing basic semiconductor manufacturing to India, while Mission 2.0 aims to enhance design capabilities and nurture deep-tech startups. The government's policies and stable economy are expected to attract significant investment, with projected AI-related spending rising to over $200 billion.

The IT sector is witnessing a growth trend, driven by factors such as rising demand and a robust talent pool. Data centers are playing a crucial role in supporting this growth, and the government's plans to attract investment in this sector are expected to boost the industry further. 

Innovation in energy conservation is being encouraged through the development of solutions that can reduce energy consumption by approximately 35%. Emerging micro-nuclear power solutions are also being explored to address energy demands for AI data centers.

India's reputation as a stable and trusted partner is attracting global players in various sectors, including electronics and semiconductors. This is evident in the growth of companies such as Shringar House of Mangasuthra Ltd., a jewelry manufacturer, which is seeing strong demand despite higher gold prices. 

The market is being driven by a sell-off following the budget, with volatility remaining. However, certain sectors such as jewelry and metal stocks are showing upside potential. Banks, on the other hand, are focusing on recovering margins and improving balance-sheet health. IDFC First Bank is witnessing growth in various areas, including CASA ratio and deposit growth. 

RR Kabel is pushing for growth through volume expansion and diversification of markets. Its capex plan aims to add approximately $4.5 billion to the top line over the next three years. 

In other news, a company is expected to grow its Assets Under Management (AUM) by 20-22% year-over-year, staying in line with its earlier guidance. Disbursement growth has been strong in Q3, and Q4 is projected to see a further increase.

Market analysts have been sharing their perspectives on the recent Budget 2026, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. The fiscal deficit's containment and data centre tax incentives aimed at attracting AI investment are seen as positive trends. However, the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) increase, which mainly affects high-frequency traders, has overshadowed these developments.

According to S Narayan, the STT hike is unlikely to benefit retail investors, who have historically lost money in derivatives. Fixed-income investors are also cautioned, as the modest small-savings-scheme borrowing target may underestimate actual collections. As a result, net borrowing could be lower than forecast despite higher gross yields.

The reopening of ICICI's small-cap fund after a 22-month suspension is seen as a precautionary move rather than a bullish signal, with valuations remaining high across asset classes. Precious metals are also viewed as volatile and too sensitive for standalone exposure, with advisors recommending multi-asset portfolios and cautioning against silver ETFs.

Foreign-institutional investors remain interested in India due to its strong structural story, but high global valuations limit aggressive equity allocations. A broader global equity correction could occur within the next two years, which would likely benefit Indian equities. AI stocks have not entered a bubble and are seen as a stable option.

Meanwhile, high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, which supply much of the market depth, are expected to face thinner margins and potentially withdraw, straining liquidity for both futures and options. The STT hike is portrayed as a deterrent to speculative activity rather than a revenue source, though the government is raising taxes across capital-market instruments.

The defense budget has seen a 17% year-over-year rise, identifying growth segments in equipment, construction, and high-mobility vehicles. Defence-focused stocks such as Bharat Dynamics Ltd and Bharat Mahanagar Nirman Ltd have been picked as top picks by Harshit Kapadia.

For railways, volume growth is confined to coaches and locomotives, with track-doubling and new-line projects showing volume declines but higher value due to price inflation. The budget announcements have sparked interest in railways, prompting incremental buying of mentioned stocks. Market trends have been relatively flat, with the next move driven by broader trends rather than early-session noise.

Market snapshots show the Sensex up and the Nifty around a critical level. Nifty Bank has fallen significantly, while mid-cap and small-cap have declined marginally. Oil-related company shares have seen pressure, while defense company shares, such as BEL, have risen on optimism around defense spending.

Banking and finance companies, IDBI Bank, have seen gains on divestment targets. Infrastructure company shares, RVNL and Anand Raj, have seen significant gains following an earlier rally. Overall, the market remains relatively flat, awaiting trends to drive the next move.

A market analysis indicates a healthier outlook than suggested by a recent sell-off. Yesterday's market decline is deemed an over-reaction, with the budget's spending-driven signals perceived as positive. The government's capital expenditure (CapEx) is only down around 2% year-over-year (YoY), with a significant increase in defense outlay and substantial allocation to power and railways. This is expected to benefit stocks related to these sectors.

Order bookings for the defense sector are robust, with a significant order-to-book ratio for HAL, BDAL, and VAL. It is anticipated that earnings growth in the defense sector will be around 18-20% over the next 2-3 years as execution ramps up. Valuations for defense stocks, such as HAL and Aircons, are considered relatively undervalued.

The railways and infrastructure sector is expected to experience a re-investment growth of around 11%, driven by projects such as double-tracking and electrification. This is likely to boost earnings and attract foreign capital. The data-center and tech infrastructure sector is set to benefit from a 21-year tax holiday for foreign firms setting up data centers, positioning companies offering end-to-end data-center solutions well.

Rising yields may impact short-term treasury income for banks, but fundamentals remain sound. Collection quality is solid, and the long-term view for banks remains positive. The IT sector is expected to benefit from reduced capital-gains tax on buybacks for promoters and non-promoters. The defense and infrastructure sector is expected to gain from higher CapEx, with significant growth planned for core CapEx, and a budgeted growth of 8-11% for FY27.

The market outlook remains uncertain following a sharp sell-off in the previous day, with the Nifty down by approximately 500 points. A brief recovery was erased in the final 30 minutes, leaving the index vulnerable to further decline. Technical analysis suggests that support levels for the Nifty are at 24,572, with potential exposure to the August 8 low of 24,337 in the event of a break below. Resistance for the Nifty Bank index is at 58,000.

Financial and institutional investors (FIIs) are expected to participate fully in the market today, potentially affecting market sentiment. A significant portion of foreign investment in index futures has been short-sold, with a substantial exposure to longs at a low 12%. Put-call ratios have fallen to 0.59, indicating oversold conditions.

The recent volatility in commodities, particularly metals, has impacted related stocks. In the IT sector, the budget introduces changes to buy-back policies, which are expected to have a positive impact on IT stocks. Defens, core capital expenditure, power, financials, and pharma/biotech sectors are also anticipated to benefit from the budget.

The budget introduces a comprehensive plan aimed at encouraging self-reliance, export growth, and long-term investment certainty. Major highlights include the announcement of a new semiconductor mission and a large electronics-manufacturing outlay, along with a 20-year tax holiday for foreign cloud-data-center investors. The budget incentivizes processing of critical minerals, shifting the focus from extraction to value-added refining. Infrastructure and logistics are also a focal point, with new railway and water-corridor networks to lower logistics costs and ease of doing business.

Reduced customs duties on inputs for leather, footwear, textiles, and other low-skill manufacturing sectors seek to expand jobs and export competitiveness. The budget also introduces a 20-year tax holiday for data-center and cloud firms in Gift City, providing long-term certainty to attract global financial-services institutions. Defense capital expenditure has been increased, with a focus on modernization and procurement of aircraft and aero-engines.

A recent interview with LIC CEO R. Doraiswamy highlights the 2026 budget as a visionary, long-term growth plan aimed at making India a top-three global economy by 2047. According to Doraiswamy, the budget prioritizes three key areas: infrastructure and strategic sectors, including high-speed rail, waterways, and capital-intensive projects such as semiconductors, defense, and biopharma; the strengthening of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); and rural income growth through higher earnings in agriculture and livestock.

The budget's focus on infrastructure development is expected to create ample investment opportunities in the insurance sector. The insurance industry is anticipated to benefit from the growth in domestic consumption and the expansion of buying power in rural areas. 

The budget introduces several measures to simplify tax law, including the Income Tax Act 2025, which aims to reduce litigation and broaden assessment windows. The government has also raised the tax on futures and options trading to curb speculation.

The budget emphasizes the importance of fiscal prudence, despite geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. Officials note that the recent GST rationalization, which exempts individual life and health insurance from tax, is a positive step towards making products more affordable and driving rural insurance uptake.

Key budget measures aimed at boosting exports and employment include sector-specific benefits for industries such as textiles, shrimp, and jewelry, as well as targeted incentives for IT, data centers, and export-oriented sectors. The government also plans to launch a grant-based infrastructure fund and develop inland waterways to promote economic growth.

Additionally, the budget aims to protect strategic supply chains and promote domestic growth through calibrated import duty and export policies. The government's focus on self-reliance and making India an attractive destination for investors has been emphasized through the introduction of measures such as a "notified data center" scheme, which exempts global income of cloud-service providers from tax.

Overall, the budget is seen as a broader push for India's economy amid global headwinds, with a focus on structural reforms, fiscal discipline, and targeted incentives for strategic sectors.

A recent CNBC-TV18 interview with Revenue Secretary S. Srivastava and DIPAM Secretary A. Chawla discussed key takeaways from the 2026 Union Budget. Various topics, including budget-related points and tax reforms, were addressed by Raamdeo Agarwal and banking officials.

Raamdeo Agarwal highlighted the 22-year tax holiday for data-center projects as a “laudable” move that could turn India into a global AI factory by attracting capital-intensive infrastructure and leveraging low power and real-estate costs. This move is expected to aid domestic data-center builders, though concerns remain about foreign-served clouds and data-sovereignty.

Analysts noted that the new allowance for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to invest via Portfolio Management Services (PMS) is a marginal, short-term factor that may help only if markets perform well. The increase in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is expected to make many high-frequency and arbitrage trades unviable, leading to reduced market liquidity and bearish pressure.

Excise duty on oil products has been raised to 6%, with analysts expecting modest volume growth to absorb the impact. Banking officials stated that the ₹17.2 lakh crore borrowing target is slightly above expectations but manageable through RBI operations, with ongoing banking-sector reforms seen as a significant long-term positive.

The removal of the 20% set-off for mutual-fund dividends against interest on borrowings was judged to be a minor, largely individualised tax change with limited macro impact. The Union Budget aims to temper excess speculation with the hike in STT on futures and options, estimated to bring in ₹15,000-₹15,500 crore in revenue if volumes remain unchanged.

GST buoyancy is expected to improve with GST rationalisation and consumption-pattern shifts, with current GST collections nearing ₹1.96 lakh crore and growth at around 6.5% monthly. The budget also aims to diversify non-tax receipts through disinvestment and asset monetisation, with a composite target of ₹80,000 crore.

The possible change to the government-company definition is under policy deliberation, with the Economic Survey suggesting lowering the 51% government-ownership ceiling to 26%. This could open up more strategic stakes while retaining control. The budget also incentivises foreign cloud-infrastructure build-out with a safe-harbour margin of approximately 15% of turnover.

A safe-harbour framework for IT-services and electronics manufacturing aims to give certainty and encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) despite rupee weakness. Restructuring of PFC and RDC is intended to create a central financing agency for power sector projects, achieving economies of scale.

The OFS pipeline is expected to see 3-4 live transactions this fiscal year and potentially double in the next year, depending on market conditions. Revenue growth is tied to the macro-economy, assuming nominal GDP growth of 10%, and no specific risk beyond economic performance.

An interview with NSE CEO Ashish Kumar Chauhan highlights the recent hike in securities-transaction tax, mainly on futures, as a response to criticism of excess speculation. The increase is expected to have a short-term impact on volumes, particularly for high-frequency traders who must adjust their algorithms, but the long-term effect is anticipated to be limited.

Meanwhile, the Indian derivatives market continues to expand, driven by wider retail access and technological advancements. The market size has surged since 2014, with the number of investors and market capitalisation rising roughly 7-8 times. Daily trades have increased significantly, from approximately 10,000 in the 1990s to around 30 crore.

A guest argues that the budget's increase in securities-transaction tax on futures and options is a misguided attempt to curb retail speculation, drawing retail traders into a derivative market that benefits brokers, foreign portfolio investors, and the government at the expense of genuine capital formation.

The budget highlights the government's efforts to bolster productivity, job creation, and long-term growth through capital expenditure, particularly in the electronics and semiconductor sectors. The Electronics Component Scheme has received increased funding, aiming to meet the huge demand and boost component production, ultimately creating over 25 lakh jobs.

The budget also focuses on making India a global supplier of semiconductors and positioning the country as a semiconductor hub over the next 20 years. Efforts are being made to attract companies such as ASML, Applied Materials, LAM Research, and Tokyo Electron to invest in the sector.

Additionally, the budget provides tax incentives and a safe-harbor provision for the IT services sector, defining a profit margin of 15.5% and accelerating accelerated APA arrangements. A 22-year tax holiday has been announced for data-center investors, expected to raise total investment from $70-90 billion to approximately $200 billion.

The budget also allocates ₹16 lakh crore for implementing high-speed corridors, including the Delhi-Varanasi and Chennai-Bengaluru routes, which are expected to attract significant investment over approximately 4,000 km. A railway budget of ₹2.78 lakh crore has been proposed, focusing on safety, new rolling stock, and a Dedicated Freight Corridor.

The government aims to position India as a global hub for IT services, data centers, electronics, and semiconductors, leveraging a large talent pool and robust policy frameworks. Significant fiscal incentives and strategic infrastructure projects are being implemented to catalyze employment and productivity gains across all sectors.

Tax holiday for data-center investors is tied to compliance with the DPDP framework and other regulatory norms. The data-center ecosystem is expected to generate multiplier effects, driving demand for server manufacturing, ATMP services, and custom silicon.

The budget's emphasis on creating employment and productivity gains is underpinned by the DPDP Act and the government's efforts to attract investment in strategic sectors. The DPDP Act is portrayed as internationally trusted, mitigating data-localisation concerns.

Implementation of the budget's proposals will start immediately, with significant investment in infrastructure projects such as high-speed corridors and Dedicated Freight Corridors. The government's focus on safety, new rolling stock, and improved operating efficiency is expected to have a positive impact on the rail sector.

Strategic infrastructure projects and tax incentives will continue to drive economic growth, creating employment and productivity gains across all sectors.

The Indian Union Budget 2026 has been analyzed by multiple executives and experts in the finance and banking sectors. According to Umesh Revankar, Executive Vice-Chairman of Sriram Finance, the government's large borrowing plan could push bond yields higher, potentially affecting lenders. However, Revankar highlights several positive budget measures, including increased emphasis on the debt market, a Banking Reforms Committee, and support for technology-driven credit innovations in the non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector.

Revankar further explains that the market has overreacted to the budget, with limited attention given to agriculture. He notes that while manufacturing dominates the agenda, the overall budget is pragmatic and expects normalization within three to six months. Additionally, Revankar welcomes the initiatives for MSMEs and biopharma that could expand international market access.

Nilesh Shah, MD and CIO of Kotak AMC, shares similar sentiments regarding the budget's impact on markets, particularly in the capital market. He notes that higher Securities Transaction Tax (STT) will hurt speculators and capital-market firms, but could provide revenue collection from traders. Shah also praised the new buy-back tax rules that differentiate promoters from non-promoters, suggesting a corrective step in taxation.

The budget has allocated ₹40,000 crore to the Electronic Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS) to create a $500 billion electronics manufacturing ecosystem by 2030-31. The larger allocation is expected to generate more approvals for EMS firms. FM Sitharaman has proposed several tax and structural reforms, including increasing STT on equity futures and options premium, treating buybacks as capital gains, and setting up a Banking Reforms Committee.

Rajiv Anand, MD and CEO of IndusInd Bank, notes that the budget's credible nominal growth, heightened CapEx focus, and stronger push for MSME payments will expand the bankable MSME universe and drive loan growth. He also highlights the introduction of total-return swaps to deepen the corporate bond market, benefiting various stakeholders.

Furthermore, the budget has introduced the Biopharma Shakti scheme, a ₹10,000 crore initiative to turn India into a biopharma hub by building domestic biologics manufacturing. The scheme includes the establishment of three new NYPA institutes, upgrading existing ones, and creating over 1,000 accredited clinical-trial sites.

The market reacted sharply to the budget announcement, with the Nifty falling by approximately 500 points and the Sensex dropping by nearly 1,500 points. This sell-off was attributed to the unexpected increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on derivatives, which spooked investors and impacted brokers such as Angel One, BSE, and CDSL. Defense stocks, despite higher allocations, saw profit-taking, while PSU banks sold off due to a higher gross market borrowing figure.

Despite the negative sentiment, certain sectors performed well, including data-center players, AMS firms, IT services, and gold-related stocks. The government's announcement of a tax holiday for foreign cloud-service providers using Indian data centers has been seen as a positive development, aiming to boost data-center capacity and attract major players like AWS and Google.

Amit Jeswani forecast the market to remain flat until a new leader emerges, as the STT hike has left portfolios down significantly. He identified commodities and precious metals as having already sold off, with data-center and AMS stocks lacking attractive valuations. The focus is now on preserving capital and waiting for earnings-driven growth or a surprise catalyst.

The government announced a series of measures to stimulate growth, including a record public expenditure of 4.4% of GDP, the highest in a decade. The budget also aims to boost technology-driven productivity gains and sector-specific incentives. A substantial allocation of ₹10,000 crore over five years has been made for domestic biologics and biosimilars. Investments in the semiconductor mission, rare-earth corridors, and chemical parks are also expected to reduce import dependence.

The budget further emphasizes the importance of supporting MSMEs, with a ₹10,000 crore SME Growth Fund, a ₹2,000 crore top-up to the Self-Reliant India Fund, and enhanced liquidity through the T-REDS platform. Professional assistance is also being provided to create corporate "MITRAs" for MSMEs.

Additionally, the budget focuses on improving the health-care sector, with an expanded health-worker cadre, mental health emphasis, and customs-duty exemptions for essential cancer drugs. The capital-receits target has been raised to ₹80,000 crore, with a strong emphasis on asset-monetization pipelines, especially in CPSC. Banking and financial-sector reforms are also on the agenda, with a high-level committee reviewing reforms up to 2047.

The government is framing its budget as a services-led, middle-income plan built on three pillars: growth, aspirations, and inclusivity. Measures focus on services expansion, with a permanent standing committee on services to coordinate reforms across 30-40 ministries. Efforts include the establishment of health hubs, development of university cities with research parks, and initiatives in tourism, AYUSH, sports, and education.

The budget also highlights manufacturing importance, nearing operationalization of the National Manufacturing Mission and enhancing existing schemes in bio-pharma, electronic components, and textiles. Import-duty rationalization is modest, focusing on pain-point relief for sectors such as warehouses and export-intensive sectors.

Indirect-tax tweaks are designed to ease input costs for manufacturers, while direct-tax incentives include expansion of the safe-harbour provision for Global Capability Centres and reduction of safe-harbour for presumptive taxpayers. The budget also features restructuring of financial institutions, such as PFC and REC, to channel green and climate finance into energy-sector electrification and transport.

Strategic infrastructure and city-level competitiveness are being invested in, with city-economic-region plans announced, and a "challenge" fund of ₹5,000 crore to turn them into global-city equivalents. Additionally, ₹10,000 crore is allocated for container building and ship-repair clusters. The Finance Minister has kept the fiscal deficit at 4.3%, reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio, and raised capex to ₹12.2 lakh crore.

Key initiatives include ₹5,000 crore per city for economic regions, seven high-speed rail corridors, and a ₹1 lakh crore urban-rejuvenation scheme. A 100% tax exemption for data centres has been announced until 2047 to attract AI and data-center investment. Disinvestment targets total ₹80,000 crore, with plans to privatize more banks and insurance firms.

The key highlights of the 2026 Union Budget have been emphasized to strengthen the country's growth trajectory. The government has accepted the 16th Finance Commission's recommendations, with a retention of 41% of vertical devolution and a commitment of ₹1.47 lakh crore in assistance to states. This move aims to keep infrastructure pipelines flowing, with a notable increase in capital outlay for defence, rising 22% to ₹2.2 lakh crore in the fiscal year 2026. 

Additionally, the budget retains its focus on removing policy bottlenecks and easing business, with an emphasis on removing policy bottlenecks and easing business rather than offering fresh equity-side stimulus. The continued bias toward capex over consumption-driven measures supports the self-reliant agenda and reinforces the doubling of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) allocation to ₹40 lakh crore. 

However, the budget faces challenges, including the impact of higher Securities Transaction Tax (STT) and short-term LTCG tax on retail participation. These measures may dampen market sentiment, but the fundamentals remain strong, driven by factors such as EPS growth, FII inflows, rupee stability, and a US-India trade deal. The market's focus will remain on the government's commitment to structural reforms in key sectors, including power, banking, and manufacturing, as these efforts will play a crucial role in determining the success of the budget. 

Moreover, the government's efforts to enhance the bond-market infrastructure through reforms, such as the Total-Return Swaps (TRS) on corporate bonds, demonstrate a commitment to improving market access and reducing borrowing costs. The emphasis on infrastructure and SME inclusion in the budget underscores the government's desire to boost overall economic growth and its ambition to become a global manufacturing hub. The budget's "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas" mantra aligns with India's goal of adding ₹5 trillion to its GDP over the decade. 

A high-level committee on bank reforms has been announced, but deeper reforms are still needed to address the sector's investment needs. The ongoing reforms in the power sector are crucial, and the budget's focus on these measures aims to alleviate sectoral bottlenecks and promote sustainable growth.

A budget announcement has been made, affecting various sectors of the Indian economy. Security Transaction Tax (STT) on futures has been increased from 0.02% to 0.05%, while options have seen a hike from 0.1% to 0.15%. This tax increase has resulted in a market sell-off, affecting stocks such as BSC, GRO, and Andhraki Wealth.

Buy-back tax reforms have also been implemented, with buy-backs taxed as capital gains rather than under the previous slab-rate system. Co-promoters will be taxed at 22%, while non-co-promoters will be taxed at 30%. The impact on retail investors remains unclear. The government has also set a capex target of ₹12.2 lakh crore, a 9% year-over-year increase.

In the IT sector, the safe-harbor limit has been raised from ₹300 crore to ₹2,000 crore. Resident individuals abroad have seen their equity investment limits increased from 5% to 10% of their total holding. The Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) TDS has been reduced from 5% to 2% for medical and educational remittances.

The government has also announced various other compliance changes, including updates to IT returns, customs procedures, and related regulations. Fiscal deficit has been set at 4.3% of GDP for the fiscal year 2027, slightly higher than market expectations.

The government has also proposed various other measures, including the creation of a new national institute for mental health and trauma care, as well as the development of an integrated East-Coast industrial corridor. The finance ministry has also accepted the Sixteenth Finance Commission's recommendation to retain a 41% vertical devolution.

The upcoming 2026 Indian budget is expected to be fiscally prudent, with approximately ₹12 lakh crore in capital expenditures to boost the overall market. A comprehensive review of foreign exchange policies is proposed. The budget will likely focus on reforming India's equity-tax regime, aligning incentives with employment to boost long-term capital inflows and manufacturing growth.

To address the current long-term capital gains tax, a three-holding period bracket system is proposed, with tax rates of 20%, 12.5%, and 0% for investments held for one year or less, one to three years, and more than three years, respectively. This reform aims to encourage patient investment and increase allocations from domestic investors. Additionally, foreign investors may face a lower tax drag, making Indian assets more attractive despite existing withholding tax on rupee gains.

The budget will also introduce a new emphasis on manufacturing, with a focus on high-growth "new-age" sectors such as defense, electronics, and semiconductors. Traditional export-oriented industries, such as textiles and jewelry, will also be targeted under new free-trade agreements. A shift from Production-Linked Incentives (PLIs) to Employment-Linked Incentives (ELIs) is proposed, tying subsidies to formal job creation rather than output alone.

Infrastructure development will play a significant role in the budget, with a focus on inland waterways and logistics, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), and high-speed rail corridors. The government aims to increase the share of inland-waterway and coastal-shipping from 6% to 12% by 2047. Coastal-cargo promotion schemes and ship-repair hubs will be established to develop skilled manpower.

The budget is expected to boost the market, and analysts suggest that India is a buy-on-the-whole-market play, with specific bullish calls on certain sectors and companies.

A panel of experts, including Neeraj Seth, founder-CIO of 3R Investment Management, and Madhu Kela, anticipate significant changes in the upcoming budget. They expect the government to roll back long-term capital-gains tax, thereby instantly boosting equity sentiment, and to allow a slightly higher fiscal deficit to spur growth while maintaining a clear five-year consolidation path. A stable fiscal policy and modest deficit boost are crucial for continued sectoral growth, particularly in financials, consumer discretionary, autos, and IT services.

Manufacturing and innovation are key focus areas, with the government looking to push India as a hub for manufacturing, semiconductors, and AI. A massive boost in R&D investment is needed to achieve this goal, and the government could incentivize R&D, although balancing proof-of-impact requirements with safeguards against misuse is essential. Customs reform is also expected, with proposals to rationalize the eight customs duty rates to a simpler structure and introduce "Vishwas"-type schemes to release stuck funds.

Taxation and market sentiment remain crucial, with market pressure to lower or eliminate securities transaction tax (STT) and capital-gains tax. However, fiscal constraints limit the government's ability to make sweeping rate reductions. Instead, stakeholders seek clearer and more stable guidance on tax treaties, especially after recent Supreme Court rulings affecting VC and PE investors. There are also calls for aligning taxation and treatment of listed and unlisted bonds and improving debt-indexation rules for mutual funds.

The panel expects tangible progress on customs simplification and R&D incentives, while tax reforms will focus on certainty and modest adjustments rather than sweeping rate reductions. Neeraj Seth remains bullish on certain sectors, such as financials, consumer discretionary, and autos, while viewing IT services as mixed, with attractive valuations but pressure from AI and regulatory risks. Overall, Seth looks for stability in fiscal policy, a modest deficit boost, and continued growth in the mentioned sectors.

Madhu Kela suggests that retail investors should stick to a disciplined asset-allocation model rather than chase short-term moves in gold or silver. He expects the government to continue fiscal prudence and consolidation, given its 11-year track record. The budget's watchlist will include key performance indicators (KPIs) tied to growth, particularly infrastructure and capital expenditure. The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has been successful in boosting electronics, and Kela hopes it will expand to more sectors, with incentives for data-centre development to spur hardware, power, and ancillary industries.

The market opened flat on budget day with the Nifty hovering around 25,260-25,274. Despite the metal weakness, the Nifty Bank held relatively steady, serving as a support, while defence stocks showed modest gains and private banks performed well. 

The Nifty and other benchmark indices have shown mixed trends in the past three budgets, with the Nifty mostly moving lower on the day of the budget. However, the week after each budget has shown little directional change for both benchmarks and broader indices. The overall index performance since the last budget has been positive, with the Nifty increasing by approximately 7% and the Nifty Mid-Cap and Small-Cap decreasing by approximately 5% and 4%, respectively. 

Sector-wise, metals and PSU banks have benefited from the budget environment, while real estate, media, FMCG, and IT have lagged. Small-cap stocks have also shown mixed results, with a few double-digit gains offset by steep declines in others. The sector performance since the last budget has seen metals and PSU banking performing strongly, while real estate, media, FMCG, and IT have underperformed. 

Some notable stock highlights include Sun Pharma, which reported a revenue increase of 13% and profit beating estimates, with growth drivers in India, the US, and emerging markets. NTPC reported a revenue decline but improving power trends, while Cholamandalam Investment reported a loan increase and net interest income expansion. IDFC First Bank reported a net interest income increase and profit growth, while Jindal Steel reported a revenue beat but margin miss due to lower realizations and higher iron-ore costs. 

The defence sector may see a 15-20% allocation increase, with watches on HAL, BEL, BDL, and Garden Reach Builders. The textiles and gems/jewellery sector may see possible interest subsidies, credit guarantees, or incentives to sustain exports. The divestments of IDBI Bank, LIC, and PSU banks are ongoing, while the future-facing industries may see targeted incentives for AI, data centres, semiconductors, and renewable energy.

The Indian market's current state is characterized by a decline of approximately 4% from its January peak, with the Nifty experiencing a fall, and major sectors such as banks, IT, and Reliance witnessing downward trends of around 1.5%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. Mid-cap and small-cap stocks have also seen declines, with small-cap and Nifty-Next-50 stocks falling 13-14% from their highs, with some stocks experiencing losses of up to 20-40%.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have significantly reduced their investment in the Indian market, with cash sales amounting to approximately ₹3 lakh crores in FY-2025. Furthermore, FIIs have been net-short on futures, with approximately 88% of their positions being short, while clients have been net-long, highlighting a discrepancy in FII and client sentiment.

In anticipation of the upcoming budget, market analysts are expecting a capex-led stimulus, which may involve a 10-11% increase in government spending. Additionally, a slight fiscal deficit "slip" is anticipated to boost nominal GDP growth, and possible tax tweaks may be implemented to revive market sentiment. Market observers are closely watching the possible reversal of the ITC tax hike, which can potentially swing the stock by 5-11% on budget news.

The current earnings season has shown limited negative surprises, with a second-half earnings pickup expected. Rural-urban consumption is at a turning point, with the RBI policy meeting upcoming, and global cues, including the US Fed chair's strategy, commodity prices, and tariff dynamics, also playing a significant role in shaping market sentiment.

In terms of the technical outlook for the Nifty, immediate support is expected at 25,200, with the 20-day and 50-day MA levels also approaching this mark. The prior lows around 25,000 and the previous record high of 26,373 are potential resistance levels. 

Key stocks such as defense and railway companies, pharmaceutical firms, auto and industrial companies, banking and financial institutions, NBFCs, and other companies are being closely monitored for potential budget-related triggers. However, defense companies such as Bharat Dynamics are expected to face deteriorating fundamentals.

Market sentiment remains subdued but not necessarily bearish, with a moderate positive surprise in the budget potentially sparking a rebound, especially if capex-driven spending and tax relief materialize while FIIs remain defensive.
