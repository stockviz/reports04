Sarvam AI, founded by Pratyush, developed 30-billion- and 105-billion-parameter models within eight months using a 15-person team and government-provided compute. A mixture-of-experts architecture enabled sparsity, reducing computational costs while maintaining competitive performance. Training was conducted across all 22 Indian scheduled languages, supporting medium-complexity applications. The company targets BFSI, education, defense, and enterprise sectors, with consumer-facing products including voice AI, chat applications, and wearable glasses. Sovereign, low-cash-burn growth is pursued through strategic partnerships with central and state governments and selective fundraising, positioning Sarvam as a long-term, India-focused deep-tech AI leader.

At the India AI Impact Summit, IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and TCS CEO K Krithivasan outlined India’s rapid AI expansion. A Guinness World Record was set with 250,000 students pledging responsible AI use, reinforcing ethical standards and upcoming labeling rules for synthetic content. Regulatory frameworks are being developed to enhance user discernment of authentic versus AI-generated media. TCS projects $200 billion in AI investment over the next three years, with $17 billion allocated to start-ups. India is transitioning from a consumer-focused to a developer-centric AI hub. TCS aims to become the world’s largest AI tech services provider, leveraging deep IT expertise to build models, applications, and infrastructure. A partnership with AMD for the Helios rack signals a strategic shift into data-center infrastructure, supported by government incentives, semiconductor missions, and plans for 38,000+ GPUs (20,000 more pending). Domestic model development and in-country compute capacity are prioritized to address sovereignty concerns. Use-case focus includes healthcare, education, agriculture, and MSME support, with a proposed “UPI-for-AI” platform enabling multi-model integration. Upskilling and reskilling initiatives are emphasized, with AI expected to expand the job market rather than reduce it. Coordinated efforts among industry, academia, and government are deemed essential for India’s AI future.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon stated that the company’s competitive advantage lies in its scalable silicon portfolio, ranging from sub-2 mW earbuds to 2 kW data-center chips, enabling AI deployment at the edge. The next wave of AI value is expected to be captured by firms delivering end-to-end solutions across cloud, network, and edge devices. Smartphones are identified as the first ubiquitous AI platform, with future growth anticipated in wearables, smart glasses, and personal agents. India’s rapid digital adoption, abundant talent, and potential to become a leading AI nation were highlighted. A new venture fund was launched to support Indian AI startups, with ecosystem support provided through chips, engineering, and software. Cost pressures are anticipated to ease as edge compute scales, lowering deployment costs. Supply chain challenges, particularly DRAM shortages, are expected to normalize within the next few quarters. Physical AI—autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, and smart factories—is projected to reach an inflection point by 2026.

Ken West, CEO of Honeywell Process Technology, stated that global energy demand will continue rising due to AI, electric vehicles, and a growing middle class. Honeywell’s strategy centers on enhancing energy efficiency through digitalization and AI, with applications in buildings, data centers, and manufacturing. The company reported up to 30–50% resource savings in its own operations, including at its Hyderabad lighthouse factory. The EcoStruxure platform integrates connected products, edge control, and cloud analytics to deliver AI-driven insights across industries. Honeywell emphasized a Swadeshi approach to AI infrastructure, ensuring local design, engineering, manufacturing, and servicing.

Schneider Electric positioned itself as the backbone of India’s AI infrastructure through its “grid-to-chip, chip-to-chiller” solutions, all developed and serviced domestically. The company’s digitization journey is embodied in the EcoStruxure platform, which enables AI-driven insights across industrial, commercial, and residential sectors. Schneider leverages AI to improve energy efficiency in its own operations and promotes a self-reliant, locally built AI ecosystem.

Dario Amodei of Anthropic emphasized enterprise-focused collaborations over consumer products. India’s developer ecosystem, startups, and large firms were identified as key partners. Anthropic’s technology is described as “Lego blocks” enabling joint value creation, with a partnership announced with Infosys and further collaborations in progress. AI-driven job disruption is acknowledged, with new roles such as “forward-deployed engineers” expected. Proactive reskilling is recommended. Model safety is ensured through extensive stress-testing, likened to automotive crash tests. Concerns regarding autonomous weaponry and mass surveillance, particularly in U.S. national-security contexts, are noted. Anthropic has raised $30 billion, with each model currently profitable, though future investments require substantial capital. Continued advances across software engineering, finance, biomedicine, and cybersecurity are anticipated without a single breakthrough. The company reaffirmed its commitment to democratic values and Indian partnerships.

At the 2026 FE India Awards, industry leaders discussed the impact of AI, shifting consumer habits, and evolving media on advertising. AI is recognized as a tool that accelerates ideation and execution, but true creativity is deemed inherently human. The interdependence of award-winning work, business effectiveness, and client growth was underscored.
